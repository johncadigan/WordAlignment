each of them is very complex , but the link between the two is even more complex which makes the whole situation for most people understandably confusing .
the commissionners went on :
they are constrained by limits which are imposed in order to ensure that the freedom of one person does not violate that of another .
it made the buying and selling of sex on our streets legal for all intents and purposes .
the way in which Bill C - 49 has been presented today gives us the feeling that only the prostitutes are punished and stigmatized .
I never met a street hooker who wanted to be there .
the establishment of the standing committee by unanimous consent of the House on June 28 , 1985 has already been noted .
I have stressed the CDC as an example of creative , aggressive effective public ownership .
so far , around $ 250,000 have been issued by the institute in grants for research or public education activity .
let me conclude .
I think we should take a hard look at this justification to determine whether or not it is cost effective and in the public interest .
however , that raises some very pertinent questions given the cut - backs announced in the Budget last spring .
we see the licence fee going up from $ 25 to $ 500 .
it would have been easy to say that these sanctions have to be followed rather than making them voluntary .
we have to introduce meaningful programs for rehabilitation within our prison system .
we should count our blessings that we do have a very safe country .
they , of course , mobilized considerable support across the country .
what does it mean for a family earning $ 35,000 where the husband and wife both work ?
I want to make it clear that we have to let this issue come to a vote today .
the Prime Minister and the Cabinet do not want to spend that money in British Columbia .
they need toys and entertainment .
obviously it does not do one bit of good for the poor people in our society .
I think that is putting it in a very whole context as to what the principles are and what our responsibilities ought to be .
however , there is no action forthcoming .
we will have given up so much ground that we will be weaker than we need to be .
under this Bill it would be unlawful for a passenger in a taxi to ask a driver how to contact a prostitute .
if they could not pay their fine and no one would raise bail for them they simply stayed in .
as you are well aware , Mr. Speaker , when Governments act under political pressure , they make bad laws at times .
this Bill pretends , and I say pretends , to do something about employment equity .
however , there was essentially no enforcement mechanism or method of ensuring that native people and women really became involved in the process .
they want to see results .
treasury Board has been responsible for affirmative action in the Government of Canada for some years now and women have little to show for it .
women workers are still confined to most of the job ghettos .
it is very important that we look at employment equity within the federal job - creation programs .
again yesterday , Mr. Speaker , we saw the Prime Minister ( Mr. Mulroney ) break his word .
what will be the cost of this particular ruling in terms of lost tax revenue as it is applied to other corporations ?
as soon as the growers begin to earn inadequate incomes , those who supply the growers and offer support services in the community begin to suffer .
2 .
2 .
oh , oh !
oh , oh !
oh , oh !
let us remember , Mr. Speaker , that these segments of our society form the backbone of our economy .
hear , hear !
hear , hear !
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Transport .
both have many years experience in the manufacture and distribution of forest products .
1 .
another point I should like to discuss is the right of the supplier to choose his customers as he sees fit .
i am getting sick and tired of ministers who seem to have some hang - up with regard to the collective bargaining process .
there is just one specific item more that I would like to comment upon and then I will sit down , Mr. Speaker .
order , please .
3 .
i can refer him to no better authority on the subject than the hon. member for Don Valley , not just myself .
it is quite understandable .
in addition , it could become a serious threat to Confederation and national unity .
in view of this , we deemed it inadvisable to attend the meeting and so informed COJO .
Mr. Speaker , the minister suggested that a greater building program might lead to inflationary pressure .
i disagree with the argument advanced by the minister .
there is a lot to be said on both sides of that question .
order .
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated to the Leader of the Opposition , I would hope to make an announcement on this question on November 1 .
quite right .
it does not bring anybody closer to rehabilitation to isolate him from the public .
he left a wife and family .
on a point of order , Mr. Chairman , I am sure the hon. member for Verdun would not have denigrated my position .
can the insurance industry in turn act as an airline ?
i say this to you , Mr. Speaker : the people of Toronto know the government has no answers .
their evidence on the state of each stock was taken fully into account .
thank you very much , Mr. Speaker , and I thank hon. members for allowing me the privilege to continue .
i urge this intensive study , Mr. Speaker , for we know so little about the reasons that turn people into criminals .
the government must assist its own employees who may need another language to advance their careers .
i do not have any qualms about the type of language I use .
motion agreed to .
Mr. Speaker , no decision has been reached as yet but I should think so .
the matter of trade relations with our European counterparts should be very seriously considered .
what we should be concerned with in this country is the situation when these animals are shipped out of Canada for this purpose .
they have already given an indication of the branches they intend to close .
this minister watched while half the proceeds and profits of the Canadian agriculture industry were swept away in a budget speech .
Mr. Chairman , absolutely none .
we are analysing the report now and I hope to have some information for the House in the near future .
hear , hear !
hear , hear !
i would therefore move , seconded by the hon. member for Dartmouth - Halifax East ( Mr. Forrestall ) :
when we realize the extent of the ravages caused by organized crime in our country , we must consider deep - rooted solutions .
but oh how their popularity soared and they coasted through on that .
( 2 ) A committee is bound by , and not at liberty to depart from , the order of reference .
there is one other point I should like to make , and I do so as I feel this is a general debate .
in December there was an announcement that British Columbia would be withdrawing from CEMA .
they have also given rise to considerable opposition by hon. members in all parties on this side of the House .
those are not the lines that one should be concerned about at this time .
i have allowed the hon. member two supplementaries and in fairness I think we should go to some other hon. members .
i think that is good .
i think that the time taken in handling routine applications for changes of facilities along a pipeline , for example , has been too long .
he is the minister who is responsible for science and technology , and he does not know .
federal government carpenters get $ 6.42 in Toronto and $ 5.23 in Halifax and Moncton .
for the record I would like to refer to a press release which followed the federal - provincial conference of attorneys general in October , 1975 .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i think the railroad term is « demand loading » .
i will come to the cost of boats these days .
in most provinces , general noise regulations have been implemented , the main principle of which is as follows :
agreed .
after all , energy is used by people throughout the nation , and the government might well consider an approach using the incentive to which I have referred .
6 .
i will be glad , when we have time , to sit down with hon. members and work this matter out on a productive and prospective basis .
will the minister take action to clear up any difficulties because of the absolute need for placing the orders now , and not some months from now ?
it will spur the construction of new fishing boats and cause new processing facilities to be built .
there are many things I could say about Bill C - 19 .
i am going to say something a bit later on about that because I think it is essential to the kind of debate we are having this afternoon .
companies find that the rules are complicated , cumbersome and changing all the time .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board .
i understand that a rate of at least 70 per cent per annum is being contemplated .
it is our hope to make a decision this week .
we accept your view .
they fought an election on that position .
12 .
Mr. Speaker , I say to that : what a cruel hoax , because a hoax it is .
Mr. Speaker , we will try to stick to that suggestion .
1 . ( a ) $ 98,355 . ( b ) They are distributed through major post offices across the country .
crime is a national problem according to our constitution , while law enforcement is a provincial and local responsibility .
i submit that what I say is pertinent to the bill , to moneys being spent on medicare and the manner in which they are spent .
a few words about this disease might help to put things into perspective .
fortunately they are fewer this year , more reasonable and responsible , more conciliatory .
this bill has been before the House for more than a year .
retired December 30 , 1975 following completion of 34 years of public service .
passage of the hon. member 's motion would mean that the content requirements are spelled out in the statute and we could debate them .
this does not necessarily indicate non - compliance on the part of the parties .
i was not asking for a detailed explanation as to what he was doing .
how can so much be asked , on the one hand , and so little answered on the other ?
as a result , perhaps he will bring in different legislation which will not lay him open to the charge of censorship .
either they do their job properly , or you must get the power so that you can be sure that they do it properly .
in our national capital we have all the strains and all the divergencies of our country .
hon. John N . Turner ( Minister of Finance ) moved :
as much as I hate to admit it , there has been good legislation brought in by Liberal governments in this country --
as the member for the neighbouring riding I am well aware of his persistence and hard work .
where is the AIB ?
at the moment , that fact , unfortunately , is seen in two - thirds of the country not as an opportunity , but as a barrier to opportunity .
do not force a moratorium down our throats .
this not the first time that members of parliament are going to hear that .
the same recommendation was made in the report of the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections on April 29 of last year .
Mr. Speaker , I am afraid the hon. member is ill informed .
in the MOT accident report it is stated :
Mr. Speaker , the federal offer was for a $ 100 million program .
in most samples of this size -- that is , a group of over 500 -- this would be called negligible .
the traditional procedure for seeking new borrowing powers is to attach a clause to supply bills brought before the House .
this strikes at the roots of democracy , and it is the right of the people to know .
this would relieve the pressure on oil .
the Special Investigation Division has not been in existence since early 1975 .
moreover , this is not a matter of saying whether we are for or against some sort of assistance for adoptive parents .
let us see the documents .
canada has continued to give its support to the NATO alliance as an absolutely indispensable deterrent and an absolutely indispensable assurance of our security .
can you believe such a ban in 1978 ?
no , Mr. Chairman .
naturally , the government attempts to get the best possible deal for the Canadian public in any series of negotiations .
i would add , Mr. Speaker , that it must be continued .
if I want any statistics as to where this country stands , certainly I will not refer to the speech made by the Prime Minister .
we looked at all the implications of that .
perhaps it would be a good idea for me to quote a Timmins newspaper because maybe it relates to the hon. member .
Mr. Speaker , indeed I have the final report from the Prairie Rail Action Committee .
( ii ) ( a ) Three vehicles will be used by six Canadian experts related to the provision of technical assistance .
1979 .
and we will implement every recommendation in the Auditor General 's report , something which we have been calling for over the last ten years .
first , Mr. Speaker , I should like to make a few general remarks .
Mr. Chairman , I will see if there is such a figure available , but I would quarrel with the words of the hon. member .
i know he would not want to divert me from responding to a very serious question by his colleague .
continually we get the message from across the way that this program will cost the government something .
that is the crowd which did not like the 18 cents .
what is at issue here is the principle that the public of Canada has a right to know about the constitution of Canada .
they want to pick and choose what they will support .
do you have it in writing ?
i realize , Mr. Chairman , that there is no magic solution .
in 1978 Americans divorced 1,122,000 times .
the very result of unemployment breaks up families , and contributes to excessive alcohol and drug use .
the official opposition was trying to destroy Petro - Canada in the short six months it was in office .
instead of causing an internal schism ,
and now they are applauding themselves for voting against security of supply .
as to making contributions , I am reminded of a story .
madam Speaker , I would like to hear from the hon. member before I move my motion .
the previous speaker also mentioned they would like to have the provinces involved in preparations for any meetings .
my friend from Toronto says 53 more years .
all of those estimates indicate that Canada will be in much more trouble as a result of the National Energy Program than we were in before .
Mr. Prime Minister :
indeed , there will be more divisiveness than positive effects .
world - wide inflation is causing a severe form of economic dislocation .
the PT7 represents the beginning of a new family of engines in a power range above that of the highly successful PT6 engine .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to join in this adjournment debate --
the competition policy is as vital to an industrial strategy as the over - all plan or the specific set of plans which should be developed .
we are now talking about $ 45 billion to construct the pipeline .
these flaws are all reflected in this bill .
at this stage of the debate of the resolution , there are three specific amendments which my party proposes to introduce .
the government cannot claim that there is any change in the balance of ways and means .
a substantial provision of federal assistance for regional development comes under this program , RIDA , and subsidiary units .
what did the government do ?
he said that if we use unemployment as the solution to inflation , we will get recovery .
conservation is beginning to have its effect .
there could be a steel mill in British Columbia , for example .
order , please .
that is why professionals should not be charged for their work in progress .
i believe , Mr. Speaker , that what is happening today is a good thing but it is just the beginning .
however , the people of Canada are responsible for making those payments .
we are now faced with legislation that is designed to withdraw from programs that were introduced at a time when we could afford them .
that is why we had to import 25,000 skilled workers into this country at a time when unemployment was rising .
as Carter said back in the 1960s , « A buck is a buck is a buck » and should be taxed as such .
order , please .
all of this means a total cut over the next two years of $ 2,958 , or 15 per cent of the original $ 20,000 salary .
we heard in the news this morning that the Heath - Steele mine in northern New Brunswick is being closed down .
they are ready to follow our leadership .
we have a number of those kinds of programs and discussions going on at the present moment .
out of that momentum of ideas and activity , we have to ask ourselves , why has the development problem not been solved ?
i would like to end on a positive note , Mr. Speaker .
i want to make it plain , Mr. Speaker , that the federal government does not set retail prices .
the House met at 2 p.m.
i remind hon. members that the minister in respect of transmission lines referred to the same power that now exist .
that is truly a laudable goal with which we all agree .
madam Speaker , I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Transport .
let me come now to Petro - Canada .
this will result in tremendous savings .
unfortunately , no one seems to know what the effect will be .
we have allowed a subgovernment across the country to remove power from the House of Commons .
that is quite substantial .
what exactly is going on over there ?
madam Speaker , I will be very brief .
that Government simply tells the people what is good for them .
it is the seasonally adjusted figures which show the .5 per cent drop which are the important figures .
the Chair is really embarrassed by what is taking place .
Mr. Speaker , I am sorry , I have not seen the statement by a British firm .
fewer volunteers are available because so many women have returned to the work force .
they work with them .
it depends on the extent to which they apply themselves .
i do not know if there is a Member in this House who would oppose allocating more money for the elderly .
they also have a role to play in the food chain .
this has given a more democratic element to the things we were faced with in our constituency .
the problem is to obscure the memories of everyone who heard the Minister 's stupid statements of a week ago .
will the Ministry fill in the ravine at the end of runway 24L at the Pearson International Airport at Toronto ?
if we ever introduce such legislation , I will remind him of his offer .
my response is , so what ?
this , Sir , is what I recommend to the House .
whether that will do any good , I do not know .
that is the principle which must guide the Alliance in the future as we seek fair and verifiable agreements with the Soviet Union .
i guess the same kind of answer would have to apply to the matter of automobiles .
they are bringing before the House a Bill that will restrict those liberties .
for debate , the Hon. Member for Bow River ( Mr. Taylor ) .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
the Government refuses to believe it .
those were very challenging commitments , a sort of preview of what the very important agricultural sector might become .
there are two revolving - door syndrome and gating .
i hope he will be back with that mobilized public opinion .
i think the argument being made by the Government is faulty .
however , we do have enough money to bail out two banks .
order .
it can be stolen just as other types of property can be stolen .
and , second , Mr. Speaker , what we have been doing since last November is building up a climate of confidence .
members should know that credit unions are a very big factor in financial institutions in western Canada .
the Member for Cochrane - Superior ( Mr. Penner ) said earlier tonight that the onus is on the Government to free up its Members .
that is my point .
what of women who live far from centres where these services are available ?
they ask the Members of this House to put an end to all cuts in personnel at these shops .
it is not a question of joining ; we are well ahead .
in an article written by Dr. Kenneth Hare , recognized in this country as being one of our foremost atmospheric scientists , the following appears :
the impact is pervasive .
in other words , a subsidy of about $ 2 per bushel will come from the Reagan administration to the grain farmers of the United States .
the full report will be coming in before the fall .
if these rules were put in place , would we indeed be treating everyone in the same way ?
in them this former distinguished Speaker of the House talked about sexual harassment where some women had to disrobe to qualify for their jobs .
i am simply alerting Members to a problem that I see , given what has been happening .
the Conservatives while in Opposition , of course , said quite the contrary to what they are doing now .
in point of fact , both the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General have responded fully , as best human beings can .
does the Deputy Prime Minister believe that this is the way for a responsible Government , or an independent nation , to make an international treaty ?
the parliamentary subcommittee is considering the whole question of equality rights .
the fact is that no applications involving fewer than four student employees is being subjected to any test of whether or not the jobs are career oriented .
we also want a series of objective criteria based on factors such as those I am referring to .
if we proceed on that basis in this or in any other direction in public life , we will always be able to find excuses .
then you brought in your program , the hotel went down the tube and Fort St. John became a ghost town .
well , in six months , we did consult , we sat down with the Minister and hammered out an agreement .
the Right Hon. Member might disagree with her perspective as well .
" let us try it , " they say , " and see if it works .
approximately $ 3 million of this amount is allocated from DREE funds , with the remainder being committed by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development .
it cannot be stressed too often that Canadians are disturbed by the increase in violent crime .
grain exports are projected to fall by 25 per cent in the 1984 - 85 crop year .
we are so far behind in this field it makes the whole country feel embarassed .
they do not really change the status .
there is no longer any distinction to be made on a rational basis between an intermediate range and an intercontinental range nuclear missile .
could I ask the Member for Western Arctic for a brief answer , if possible .
greater Victoria is a tourist mecca .
that tax will not be collected and then refunded .
there has been a commitment in the past that their participation rate would go at least to historic levels if not traditional levels .
that is to say , at the request of the person who may be going to declare his refugee claim .
that is the actual situation .
equalization payments have become quite considerable through the years .
it has been a matter of concern to representatives of all parties .
i would also like to advise the House that there was a degree of consultation with respect to the PC caucus members from Manitoba .
the part played by military personnel and their families in the life of the town will be long remembered in a most favourable light .
with great respect , I must interrupt .
i explained it then .
if the Prime Minister said that he was willing to resume negociations with Quebec , why are they in such a hurry to pass this Bill ?
in fact , that is why a number of my colleagues have spoken out quite vigorously on the subject .
i should like to put on the record just exactly what is in the notes on the financial statement of March 31 , 1984 .
that judgment is sent to the individual in question .
that does not make sense .
Mr. Speaker , many authorities were involved in acting on this emergency .
however , what happened to the studies that were conducted after that incident occurred ?
there was a clear understanding by the former Minister of Transport that these regulations would not be promulgated for a year .
i feel that is an attitude in Cabinet which we do not have the luxury of allowing to continue .
in other words , Mr. Speaker , the Government must implement the recommendations of the Commissioner of Official Languages .
they will then reduce the number of jobs because what they buy will be a duplication of other operations they have .
it is at the second stage of review that the Supreme Court has ruled that a hearing is compulsory .
as for lawyers specialized in immigration matters , the Bar takes upon itself to penalize them .
the alternative in terms of foreign investment is loan capital .
does he want to wait until the economy of those rural areas is completely down before responding to the acid rain problem ?
i think that should not be too difficult to understand .
however , we must not forget that the majority of beef and pork producers have rejected outright any mechanisms for marketing stabilization .
if I had been in Bryce 's position , I would have been right in there with my nose to the public trough with the rest of them .
in other words , we consider that the political role and the administrative role should be kept separate .
as a result , the Government had to take steps to see that the company was taken over .
all of these heritage places are managed by Parks Canada for the benefit and enjoyment of all Canadians .
as I indicated earlier in this ruling , such discrimination was not envisaged in the Bill when it was given second reading .
there is a role for both the public and the private sector .
there will be more criticism , perhaps , because this Government , as I understand it , is committed to making things more open to the public .
that is not good enough .
he was the one who told us that the construction of a maintenance centre for VIA Rail in Montreal would be indefinitely postponed .
but then Mr. Baldwin said :
we want full public disclosure of company commitments involved in take - overs of Canadian business .
there is also a need to co - ordinate with provincial Governments as to what certain areas require .
they are of the opinion that by just changing the name from FIRA to Investment Canada we are going to have an automatic inflow of dollars .
can the Minister tell this House what position the Canadian Government will take in this regard ?
it is nine months since the election of this Government and we have yet to see a Budget .
we currently allow the Canadian amateur athletic associations to be registered , and it is my belief that we should allow the provincial groups as well to be registered .
a Canadian amateur athletic association by definition includes federal associations but does not include their provincial counterparts .
to this battle Canada gave 1,800 gallant sailors and 24 proud ships .
i find it incredible that the President of the Treasury Board would be laughing about a matter as serious as this .
they have also asked for additional funding .
well , everyone would agree with that .
it is no wonder that there was no permanent chief executive officer for over 12 months .
the Minister spoke of meetings and I applaud that .
we had to put that in St. John 's .
that is an accurate description of what is happening .
they cannot be treated in isolation .
he obviously does not like the co - op people in eastern Canada .
the federal Government has a responsibility to be a policing agent .
it wants to increase the percentage of its part - time workers to 45 per cent of its total work force .
in the last Manitoba provincial election , 900 mail - in votes were received and were mostly from urban voters .
what does basic common sense say ?
standards are actually stricter in abattoirs built according to Quebec regulations .
technicians make more than the writers and playwrights whose works are being performed .
they were all leftists .
it is well done .
yes , we are a small nation and we are vulnerable because of our size .
Mr. Wyman has many years of experience in the financial market sector .
let 's think about that for just a moment .
i do not think we should beat around the bush any longer about how to set things right .
it says that resource impact funding helps Indian people to get a piece of the action .
one of the major objectives of these consultations is to make sure that the recovery benefits all .
Mr. Speaker , I think that in his speech , the Hon. Member from Baie - Comeau misrepresented reality .
it is a matter of elementary justice that women 's jobs be fairly evaluated .
we intend to continue this discussion with the benefit of the views of a wide range of interested parties .
i think particularly of single parents .
the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion treats all matters related to Quebec with a great deal of fairness and honesty .
as a matter of fact that net farm income reached its lowest level since 1970 and the third lowest level since 1938 , some 45 years ago .
in the Laval - Deux - Montagnes area , $ 225,000 was spent in 1984 but only $ 30,000 will be spent this year Mr. Speaker .
this particular Minister made personal election promises that he would not only consult with fishermen but that he would be readily available when problems arise .
that investment is being neglected , primarily in British Columbia .
the outstanding issue has been the failure to make a funding commitment for the ERDA agreement .
he should come clean on this issue this afternoon instead of giving us all this gobbledy - gook .
he said that British Telecom « has not demonstrated its marketing savvy or product management ability » .
foreign investment was running Canada as though it were the fifty - first State .
it does not conduct research and development .
the first question is : why does agriculture require stabilization ?
as a general rule , all the producers of any given commodity are affected simultaneously by a cost - price squeeze .
we have a diversified riding .
so the real problem is that farmers are leaving farming .
let us go to the question of what the public seems to be saying on this issue of Senate reform .
as this is what is required , it is the target the Government has in mind .
that , I believe , we all find unacceptable , regardless of political Party .
let me return to the Bill which is before us .
it is a mistake to do what the Tories are proposing to do to differentiate their Bill .
we know how painful that can be for people who are going through a period of their life which is not particularly joyful .
the establishment of such a system should therefore be a priority in each province where it does not already exist .
we have been colleagues for a long time .
it will help Canadian companies to accelerate their return to a healthy financial position by attracting new equity investment .
the universal family allowance is maintained .
research is a low priority .
oh ?
there are increased costs for shampoo and drinks for kids , pet food , gas , and even heating the home .
this technique is not unusual on the basis of precedents .
similarly , under the last Liberal Budget , personal income increased in 1984 by 7 per cent .
but the Government treats itself to lavish spending and engages in bailing out corporations .
there will be improved survivor benefit regulations for women , standards for pension benefit splitting on marriage breakdown , and equality standards .
in fact , if one adds in some other things resulting from the Western Accord , I think it is more likely to be 2.8 cents per litre .
we follow through with our election pledges .
we must revive our economy , create jobs , rationalize government spending , administer with increased efficiency .
it does not make a lot of sense , particularly when you look at who is paying .
what will they do with that capital ?
that is roughly equal to the $ 440 million paid to Canadair in two years .
from these hearings , it became obvious that the major concern was capital gains .
it indicates to individual Canadians that for too long Government has made their decisions for them .
that brings to mind the hundreds of young Canadians I met recently , most of them quite disillusioned .
this is why I cannot find myself supportive of the request for additional funding for the Government by way of borrowing .
the Hon. Member says : « neglected Quebec » , and I agree .
i was glad to hear that Crown corporations with a commercial value but no ongoing public policy purpose will be sold .
we have taken these considerations very much into account when we designed the Budget .
will the Prime Minister live up to that commitment ?
can the Minister clarify the effect of the reduction ?
thus far , I have been describing the physical aspects of my constituency .
we believe they will accept the challenge .
can he tell them that is fair ?
it has been years and years since our business community got such a vote of confidence from Government .
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is providing the opposition .
they stood to a person and applauded loudly .
eight .
no , Mr. Speaker , not quite .
i would like now to go into the theory behind the removal of capital gains tax .
it will increase poverty in the most vulnerable people , senior citizens , who will not be able to go out and find other sources of income .
CFB Moose Jaw is also the home of the Snowbirds , Canada 's aerobatic air team .
our caucus heard the other day from the Atlantic provinces economic council .
come on , give us a break !
that is one major problem .
i wish to direct the majority of my comments today to the many improvements offered in the pension programs available to all Canadians .
furthermore , the erosion of the cost base of assets by inflation was also regarded as something that should be compensated for .
the Budget is realistic because it takes a balanced and sensible approach .
that is not the interest or concern of this Government .
they voted for a change in the national affairs of our nation .
on a point of order , Mr. Speaker .
the facts are clear .
the motion of the Hon. Member for Beaches therefore gives us an opportunity to do in this House what everyone else is now doing throughout the country .
they also have a technical library , and the company spends nearly $ 2 million annually on these research services .
second , we want to assist Canadian businesses to exploit opportunities for investment and technological advancement .
not only are the risks greater but the time required to prepare for marine re - supply is lengthy .
Mr. Speaker , once again the Liberal and NDP forecasters of economic doom and gloom have been proven wrong .
i am not going to bother boring the House with those answers again .
however , when we came into office we discovered that the trend line was going up .
only the document cited need to be tabled by a Minister .
furthermore , there is the provision in our resolution of having had to serve for a period in excess of 365 days in Canada as the basis of eligibility .
the Government said that it had not had time to talk to either group about that proposal .
in other words , the writing is on the wall .
they were saying that homeowners would lose again because interest rates were rising .
our international role has somehow collapsed .
for instance , if we look at crop insurance , the federal Government has put up half the premiums and the producers have put up the other half .
so we cannot think in those terms .
the Minister has said that the only problem with Candu and the whole nuclear power option is a marketing one .
why was it that I was receiving those kind of representations ?
» that is what the present Prime Minister told the former Prime Minister .
most of them are unable to work .
a few days ago my colleague from Essex - Windsor gave the House a history lesson .
the article reads :
he said that he was burning oil .
the Government has yet to come to the point of determining how and when this change should take place .
i referred earlier to the bet taken up by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Mulroney ) concerning employment as related to immigration .
however , we see in the legislation before us today only two substantive amendments and a number of housekeeping amendments to the Bill .
we as a society cannot afford to discriminate among individuals on that sort of basis .
this type of federal - provincial co - operation is required to increase the sensitivity and efficiency of our current disease surveillance systems .
he suggested that June at least would be a better time .
in 1934 , the company was renamed the Northern Transportation Company Limited , still under private ownership .
i do commend the Minister of Transport for following through on the original terms of reference .
then and only then does the private sector rush in saying that it cannot have all these publicly - owned corporations interfering in the private sector .
specialty services such as stand - by supply vessels for the Beaufort Sea oil and gas industry can be provided by others .
unfortunately or fortunately , however one views the issue , that particular Minister has not met with very much success .
however , perhaps the Chair could dispose of Motion No. 1 .
on the west coast we have the Minister 's Advisory Committee which , while not perfect , is at least of assistance .
this is a fine example of a partnership in progress between government and industry .
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Transport .
Mr. Speaker , let me be clear .
within the Government of Canada , a number of Departments have been actively involved and have been proceeding in a co - operative and coordinated fashion .
however , the contradiction between what he said and what has been said by his officials requires further independent investigation .
i know that we are trying to do it , at the federal level through the Farm Credit Corporation .
these are key economic indicators .
production is being expanded with the development of a sixth farm at Bowden Institution in Alberta .
that was the principle of the Bill as passed on second reading .
surely no one , and particularly no member of the Conservative Party , would believe that .
the people of Canada did that on September 4 .
call in the Members .
we think that now is the time for the regulations and procedures to be properly established .
the point was well taken because the success of these agreements will depend to a considerable degree upon the quality of their administration .
canada can be proud of its record on human rights and should serve as an example of tolerance to other countries .
whose advice did he follow in making his decision , in that his officials rejected it ?
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased that the Prime Minister has provided the information in the House .
may I therefore ask the Hon. Member to refrain from any further displays .
why did the Prime Minister appear prepared to disregard his promise in the first place ?
Mr. Speaker , I am always amused by these probing questions from the Liberal Party , the Party which says that it would control the deficit .
surely the Hon. Member is not suggesting that we levy taxes on companies that have been losing money .
Mr. Speaker , the premise of the question put by the Hon. Member is wrong .
how many people are employed ( a ) directly or by contract ( b ) full time and part time , in the Office of the Prime Minister ?
the fees paid to each performer were in keeping with the role played in the gala and with the standards of the Union des Artistes .
during the Liberal administration nothing was done about it .
they know about the overproduction problem .

it is very much appreciated and I take it to heart .
there are some who say this House will be lively in the 36 th Parliament .
i have never been in a Parliament that has not been lively .

my task is to see to it that the rights and privileges of all of you parliamentarians of Canada are protected .

my dear colleagues , thank you again for the honour that you have bestowed on me today .
and now , on to the work of this Parliament .
i thank you very much .

speech FROM THE THRONE
the Speaker :
members of the House of Commons ,
ladies and Gentlemen :
as Governor General I have visited every province and territory , and I wish every Canadian could share that experience .
our cities , towns , and villages reflect the diversity of all those who have come to this country .
and yet our communities , whether on the coasts or the prairies , whether in the woodlands or on the northern tundra , show the same friendliness , openness , and generosity .
people care for each other in many ways , and they give their time and their support to their community .
when I became Governor General , I stated my intention to honour the generosity of Canadians , especially as demonstrated by volunteers .
we have now created the Caring Canadian Award to recognize the most dedicated among them .
in my functions , I visit with many units of the Canadian Forces .
they have impressed me with their dedication , as demonstrated by their peacekeeping role , their heroic work in search and rescue , and their immediate response to natural disasters such as the Saguenay region and Red River floods .
let me mention another source of great pride : the proclamation of the twenty - first of June , the longest day of the year , as National Aboriginal Day - a day to honour the First Peoples of this land .
a New Parliament -
today marks the opening of a new Parliament , the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first Parliament of the 21 st century , a Parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the future for Canadians .
on June 2 , 1997 , the people of Canada renewed the mandate of the Government .
over the course of this Parliament , the Government will fulfil the commitments it made to the people in its election platform .
the Parliament of Canada is the only institution directly elected by all Canadians with the mandate to protect and express the national interest .
elected by all Canadians and endowed with the legitimacy that this bestows , the Government of Canada will stand up for the shared values of Canadians at home and abroad .
but governing in the 21 st century also means recognizing that no one government can act alone .
given the complexity of the issues that face us as citizens in a global economy , collaboration is an essential ingredient for the success of Canada .
more than ever , Canadians want their governments to work together in partnership .
as we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new challenges and new opportunities , we can look back at the last century of Canadian history and state with certainty that Canada is rightly regarded , the world over , as an extraordinary success .
canada represents a triumph of the human spirit , bringing together the best of what people can do .
- for a New Century of Canadian Achievement
as old and familiar constraints of time and distance are breaking down , individuals and communities can accomplish things once unimaginable .
canada is ready .
we are poised for success .
our citizens have the qualities that are needed to succeed in the 21 st century :
we have the values of sharing and mutual help .
we are well educated .
we welcome innovation and new ideas .
we are an open and democratic society .
we are a bilingual and multicultural country at a time of increasing globalization .
we have learned to accommodate our differences and diversity and turn them into strengths .
our federation makes the most of these talents .
it gives us the cohesion we need to multiply our strengths by combining our talents , by pooling our resources and by sharing risks .
it also gives us the flexibility we need to experiment and innovate in order to succeed in a rapidly changing world .
the Government wishes to recognize the important role of a professional , non - partisan public service in a well - performing civil society .
canada is served well by its public service , and the effort and dedication it exhibits in meeting the needs of citizens and in building partnerships among governments and other sectors of society .
the Government will continue to renew the Public Service of Canada to ensure its members have the skills and dedication to continue serving Canadians well .
we Have Already Built a Foundation for Our Success
in recent years , Canadians worked hard and sacrificed to overcome many of our nation ' s challenges .
we succeeded , and have started to put in place a strong foundation for our success in the new millennium .
this 36 th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances , and the economy is entering a period of strong growth .
while unemployment is still too high , hundreds of thousands of new jobs are being created by the private sector , inflation is at very low levels , and interest rates are lower than they have been in more than three decades .
more Canadian companies are selling more goods and services to the world than ever before .
stimulating job creation and economic growth has been , remains , and will continue to be a major objective of the Government of Canada .
the Government will build on the progress achieved and the foundations put in place over the last four years to strengthen the economy and increase confidence .
we will pursue this course and take further action to encourage new investment , to create new jobs , and to generate the national wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure future .
the Government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order :
it will put the debt - to - GDP ratio on a permanent downward track .
it will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998 - 99 .
it will introduce legislation to implement the proposed changes to the Canada Pension Plan and the new Seniors Benefit in order to ensure Canada ' s public pension system remains sustainable in the 21 st century .
one in three Canadian jobs depend on trade .
our prosperity and our ability to create jobs are directly linked to how well we capitalize on international opportunities .
team Canada trade missions have successfully generated new opportunities for Canadian businesses and have illustrated what we can accomplish when governments and the private sector collaborate .
the Government will build on this success with a focussed strategy , developed in consultation with industry , to improve our international economic performance by expanding Canada ' s trade base , becoming the location of choice for global investment , and making Canada a preferred tourist destination .
the Government has regained the ability to address priorities of Canadians while living within its means .
it is now in the position to make strategic investments in our children and our youth , our health , our communities , and our knowledge and creativity while continuing to improve the nation ' s finances .
the Government is committed to following this balanced approach of social investment and prudent financial management as it leads Canada toward renewed and lasting economic health and increased social cohesion .
we are making the federation better able to serve the differing needs of Canadians across the country .
Canadians feel better about their own future and the country ' s future .
we are looking to our future together with a new optimism .
the fact that we have demonstrated our ability as a country to set ambitious goals and achieve them gives us new confidence to set higher goals for the years ahead and succeed .
our Challenge for the Future
our challenge is to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward .
the future belongs to societies whose economy is sound ; who invest in knowledge , education and innovation ; whose population is healthy ; whose children are well prepared to learn ; and who focus on securing a high quality of life for all citizens .
Canadians have already set these priorities for this new Parliament .
these are the Government ' s priorities .
building a Stronger Canada
the federal , provincial and territorial governments owe it to all Canadians to take responsible leadership on the unity of the country .
the single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada united .
the Government of Canada can have no greater duty or responsibility .
the overriding goal of the Government of Canada as we approach the 21 st century is both simple and ambitious .
it is to strengthen and unite this country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live .
realizing these aspirations fully will require the active engagement of Canadians in all walks of life , as well as our institutions , businesses , voluntary organizations and our governments .
it will require collaboration and partnership .
it will require reaching out .
in their meeting last week , nine Premiers and the two territorial leaders reiterated their desire for closer co - operation with the federal government in the areas of health care and social policy .
the Government welcomes the Premiers ' and territorial leaders ' continuing interest in working together , and is committed to even closer collaboration on these important issues .
as a next step , the First Ministers will meet this fall to work on co - operative approaches to address youth unemployment , health care and social policy renewal .
the Government will take a very broad and encompassing approach to promoting and strengthening our unity .
all its major initiatives will serve to make Canada better and thus more united .
the Government will approach its mandate committed to collaboration and partnership with all its partners in Canadian society .
canada provides our common space and our common means for realizing our potential .
we would all be forever diminished , forever changed , should we fail to maintain the example Canada provides to the world .
our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding .
therefore , the Government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada .
it will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties that have developed in building a nation together .
most of all , it will demonstrate how much more we can do together than apart .
the Government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine Premiers and the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of Quebec society .
we will build on the mutual respect Canadians have for one another to achieve our common aspirations for a better future .
investing in Children
a country that has decided to invest in its children is a country that is confident in its future .
a country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future .
one of our objectives as a country should be to ensure that all Canadian children have the best possible opportunity to develop their full potential .
we must equip our children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and to participate fully in our society .
while families have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing and development of our children , they are not alone .
it requires focussing on what children need to thrive .
the experiences of Canada ' s children , especially in the early years , influence their health , their well - being , and their ability to learn and adapt throughout their entire lives .
by investing now in the well - being of today ' s children , we improve the long - term health of our society .
addressing the needs of low - income families with children is therefore a priority of the Government .
federal , provincial and territorial governments have agreed to address in a co - operative way the problems of low - income families with children .
together we are now building the comprehensive and effective National Child Benefit System .
the Government has already demonstrated its initial commitment to this project by increasing its contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by $ 850 million a year , with higher payments to families beginning July 1 , 1998 .
the Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners to establish jointly a common timetable for increasing the federal contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by at least an additional $ 850 million during the course of this mandate .
the Government will also work with the provinces and territories to establish the National Re - Investment Framework to guide the re - allocation of our partners ' savings into new services and benefits for low - income families with children .
we can make a difference in the lives of all our children .
children need a substantial investment of time and attention for healthy development ; they need strong families ; they need safe , supportive communities .
the federal , provincial and territorial governments agreed in January 1997 to work together to develop the National Children ' s Agenda , a comprehensive strategy to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children .
federal , provincial and territorial governments will work together to develop this broader agenda for children , including clear outcome measures by which to gauge success .
as part of this national agenda , the federal government will undertake three new initiatives :
it will establish Centres of Excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development and well - being and to improve our ability to respond to their needs .
it will expand our Aboriginal Head Start program onto reserves to ensure that all Aboriginal children have the opportunity to get a good start in life .
it will measure and report regularly on the readiness of Canadian children to learn , so that we can assess our progress in providing our children with the best possible start .
investing in Quality Care and Good Health
nonetheless , there is an increasing anxiety among Canadians about the present state and the future of our medicare system .
citizens worry about whether they will have access to the highest possible quality of health care when they need it .
the anxiety arises from a number of sources , including the pace and extent of restructuring that has gone on in recent years .
the federal government recognizes that this restructuring has been difficult for Canadians and , therefore , it will increase health care funding to the provinces from previously budgeted levels .
it will introduce legislation to increase to $ 12.5 billion a year the guaranteed annual cash payments to provinces and territories under the Canada Health and Social Transfer .
one of our goals as a country must be to continue providing all our citizens with access to the highest possible quality of health care and the other tools they will need to enjoy healthy lives as we move into the 21 st century .
Canadians have a right to expect their governments to work together in harmony to better meet the shared goals and desires of Canadians for a better health system .
the Government is firmly committed to a publicly administered , comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for Canadians anywhere in the country .
the Government has a leadership role in preserving and enhancing medicare .
it has a constructive role to play as a partner with provinces and other interested parties .
the Government will play that role in a spirit of openness , pragmatism and innovation .
there are steps that we can and will take to lead the efforts by all governments .
preparing Canada for the 21 st century means ensuring the medicare system meets the needs of the future .
it means responding to emerging issues in health care .
working with its partners , the Government will undertake the following initiatives :
it will take measures to support Canadians in responding to the expanding needs for home care and community care .
it will develop a national plan , timetable and a fiscal framework for providing Canadians with better access to medically necessary drugs .
it will improve the quality and effectiveness of health services across Canada by establishing the Health Transition Fund to help the provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more integration in the delivery of health services , home care and pharmacare .
Canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical care .
our social and economic situations also help to determine the quality of our health .
as a country , we must increase our efforts to promote healthy lives .
the Government will contribute to this goal with an agenda to promote good health .
emphasis will also be placed on those factors that determine the health of a country ' s population , including the equality of economic and social opportunity for all citizens .
some of the most urgent health problems today are found in Aboriginal communities .
the Government will work with other partners and Aboriginal communities to
develop new initiatives to address the rapid increase in tuberculosis and diabetes in Aboriginal communities ; and
enhance research and dissemination of health information focussed on the needs of Aboriginal people through a new Aboriginal Health Institute .
the Government will work with its provincial partners and other interested parties to improve Canadian health information systems to improve decision making about health and health care across the country .
building Safer Communities
safe communities are among the hallmarks of our Canadian identity .
while the reported crime rate has decreased for four consecutive years , it is still too high .
the Government is committed to ensuring that Canada remains a place where Canadians feel secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities .
a safe society depends on strong crime prevention efforts as well as traditional legal responses .
governments around the world are developing community - based crime prevention programs .
increase funding for community - based crime - prevention initiatives to $ 30 million per year ;
develop alternatives to incarceration for low - risk , non - violent offenders , such as sentencing reforms , community diversion programs , and alternative sanctions ; and
integrate information systems of all partners in the criminal justice system .
creating Opportunity for Young Canadians
today ' s generation of young Canadians is the best educated in our history .
young Canadians are living in a country well - positioned for opportunities in the new economy .
yet , the level of unemployment among Canadians between the ages of 18 and 25 is unacceptably high .
the federal , provincial and territorial governments will act to address this problem , and First Ministers and territorial leaders will be working on this issue when they meet this fall .
to secure our future as a society , our immediate challenge is to make sure that our young generation makes a successful transition to the world of work , that young people who want to continue to learn have access to education , and that young people who found it difficult getting started in the workplace get a second chance .
all Canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully .
no single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the answers .
we must all contribute , each in our areas of competency , to meet the challenge we have set for ourselves .
the Government welcomes the action being taken by the private sector , through initiatives such as Career Edge and the Corporate Council on Youth in the Economy , and encourages the private sector to do more .
the Government is committed to work with other governments , the private sector , communities and individual Canadians to help equip young people for the future .
an important role for governments is to ensure the widest possible access to post - secondary education .
Canadians are concerned about the increasing cost of higher education , and the resulting debt burden on students .
the Government took some important measures to address this problem in its budget of February 1997 .
the Government will continue to reduce barriers to post - secondary education through further changes to the Canada Student Loans Program , increased assistance for students with dependents , and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help low - and moderate - income Canadians attend university or college .
the Government finds it unacceptable that thousands of jobs are going unfilled in high - growth sectors of our economy at the same time as young Canadians are unemployed .
the Government will work with the provinces , universities and colleges , the high - tech industry and other rapidly growing sectors to better forecast the number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that people are appropriately educated to fill them .
three factors make a significant difference to young people getting started in the world of work - a good education , a chance at a first job , and a mentor to work with as they establish themselves .
the Government will increase its resources devoted to helping youth to make a smooth and productive entry into the world of work .
internship programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get started .
in partnership with provincial governments and the private sector , a Canada - wide mentorship program will be developed .
to help those young Canadians who need a second chance , the Government will develop and expand community - based programs for youth with the greatest difficulty making the transition to the world of work because of low education and skills .
these will include establishing multi - purpose Aboriginal youth centres that will provide targeted social and cultural support in addition to increasing work and learning opportunities for urban Aboriginal youth .
the Government will continue to support efforts of individuals , communities and other governments to improve Canadians ' capacity to learn throughout their lives .
investing in Knowledge and Creativity
the revolution in the knowledge and information economy is transforming all sectors of the economy from primary resources to service industries .
canada is well - positioned to be a world leader in the global knowledge - based economy of the 21 st century .
we have the talent , we have the resources , we have the technology , and we have the institutions .
by rising to the challenge of mobilizing our resources well , we can enable our citizens to succeed in the global knowledge - based economy .
this is how we will spur continuing job creation and sustained growth in our standard of living in the 21 st century .
the Government is determined to do more to support innovation and risk - taking in Canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge - based industries to Canada .
we will build creative partnerships between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy .
in particular , the Government will significantly increase the resources allocated to help small and medium - size businesses develop and commercialize new technology .
the Government will explore innovative policies and measures that give particular attention to increasing opportunity for Canadians in rural communities .
it will adapt its programs to reflect the social and economic realities of rural Canada .
further , the Government will redouble its efforts to ensure that rural communities and all regions of Canada share in the economic benefits of the global knowledge - based economy .
governments have a crucial role to play in supporting science , technology , and the creation of knowledge .
the Government of Canada ' s endowment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation in partnership with the private sector , the provinces and universities , is helping to build a leading - edge national system of innovation .
all levels of government must do more to provide public support for research done in our universities .
support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research .
increasing support for the arts makes it possible for Canadian culture to reach audiences at home and abroad .
our movies , books , magazines , plays , videos , music , and multi - media productions speak to us about our experiences at the same time as they present Canadian creativity to the world .
therefore , the Government of Canada will provide increased support to the Canada Council and will make special efforts to support culture at home and to promote trade in Canadian cultural and educational products and services abroad .
we will make the information and knowledge infrastructure accessible to all Canadians by the year 2000 , thereby making Canada the most connected nation in the world .
this will provide individuals , schools , libraries , small and large businesses , rural and Aboriginal communities , public institutions , and all levels of government with new opportunities for learning , interacting , transacting business and developing their social and economic potential .
for example , we will enhance the voluntary sector ' s capacity to engage Canadians by improving their access to the technology they need to play a stronger role in Canadian life .
a connected nation is more than wires , cables and computers .
it is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to benefit from Canada ' s rapidly changing knowledge and information infrastructure .
it is also a nation whose people are connected to each other .
the Government will continue to work with provinces to ensure greater mobility for people with disabilities and to ensure their integration into the economic and social mainstream of Canadian life .
the Government will also bring forward measures to strengthen networks among Canadians and to increase knowledge of Canada and understanding among Canadians ; these measures will include enhanced exchange programs for young Canadians .
expanding Opportunities in Aboriginal Communities
thousands of years ago , Aboriginal people began building Canada ' s first communities .
today , by strengthening our Aboriginal communities , we are reinforcing the diversity that makes Canada unique in the world .
the Government will
develop relationships with Aboriginal people based on the principles of partnership , transparency , predictability and accountability ;
support the building of strong Aboriginal communities - communities that provide their members with better living standards and opportunities ; and
strengthen the capacity for good government in Aboriginal communities .
to contribute , the Government of Canada is committed to respond to the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples as soon as possible .
looking Outward
this tradition is the legacy of Nobel laureate and former prime minister of Canada , Lester Pearson , whose 100 th birthday we mark this year .
Canadians want their government to carry on this tradition and give it new relevance as the world enters a new century .
nothing better illustrates the ongoing commitment to this tradition than Canada ' s leadership since 1994 in the international effort to ban anti - personnel mines .
this Canadian initiative has evolved from a bold idea to be the focus of a large and growing international consensus that will culminate in the signing of an international treaty in Ottawa in December of this year .
canada ' s rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim .
Canadians are both the beneficiaries and the stewards of a land that holds 9 % of the Earth ' s fresh water , 10 % of its forests , and 25 % of its wetlands .
Canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its future .
maintaining what is good , and improving what has been degraded , requires constant effort .
it is an effort that the Government will make .
the Government is committed to working in the international community to promote sustainable development and to achieve practical solutions to global environmental problems , such as greenhouse gas emissions and toxic chemicals .
it will also continue to address the serious international problem of over - fishing .
it is committed to acting at home to reduce our contribution to these problems .
in this same Canadian tradition of internationalism , the Government will undertake the following initiatives :
it will promote Canadian values on the world stage by co - operating with like - minded countries to revitalize the United Nations and other key multilateral institutions .
it will work directly with other countries to enhance and promote human rights , peace building and democracy .
it will destroy the Department of National Defence ' s stock of land mines , in advance of the signing of the Ottawa Treaty in December , to continue its leadership and illustrate its commitment to a global ban .
and Canada will continue to work toward an accompanying international strategy to help land mine victims recover and civilian populations reclaim their land from these mines .
it will continue to move forward with reforms to the Canadian military .
it will continue its campaign for liberalized trade .
breaking down trade barriers , both within Canada and around the world , helps ensure markets for Canadian goods and services and provides the best opportunity for greater prosperity .
celebrating the Millennium
for Canadians , the start of the new millennium represents an historic opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation and our hopes for the future .
it will be an unequalled opportunity to show ourselves and the world the richness of our diversity , the strength of Canadian values , and the great promise of our future in the 21 st century .
the Government will help build a partnership among governments , communities and citizens to mark the new millennium .
many Canadians have creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects .
there will also be an opportunity for parliamentarians from all parties to participate in developing ideas to mark the millennium .
moving Forward into the 21 st Century
almost 100 years ago , Sir Wilfrid Laurier said , " The 20 th century shall be the century of Canada and of Canadian development . "
he was right .
today , we have the opportunity for success in the 21 st century that is far beyond what Laurier could have ever imagined .
to achieve this success we have more work to do - work that no one can do alone .
each and every one of us must assume personal responsibility for our community and our country .
our greatest responsibility is to build a new spirit of sharing and mutual respect for a new century .
by working together , by respecting the value of our diversity , we will secure our future and build a stronger country .
we will ensure that our future economic opportunities are sound , our children well prepared , our lives healthy , and our communities strong .
each generation has the opportunity to choose the society it wants to leave for its children .
the greatest legacy we can leave to our children in the new millennium is a vibrant living legacy that will make Canada a better place : a stronger country with a brighter future and greater opportunities for its young people .
by working together , we will build that future .

speech FROM THE THRONE
address IN REPLY
the House proceeded to the consideration of the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General at the opening of the session .
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a very great privilege and an honour that has been bestowed upon me today to make this motion which is to be seconded by the hon. member for Beauce for the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne .
i would like to thank the Prime Minister and the government for the honour they have bestowed on the people of Parkdale - High Park with their motion .
i am also honoured and privileged to be the first member of Parliament of Latvian and Baltic States heritage to take a seat in the House of Commons , which in Latvian is stated as follows :
i would like to thank the people of Parkdale - High Park who have placed their trust and confidence in me to represent their interests in the House of Commons .
as their member I vow to work with my colleagues and in partnership with the private and non - profit sectors to address the challenges which we face today and in the future .
i would also like to especially acknowledge and thank my hon. predecessor Mr. Jesse Flis who represented the riding of Parkdale - High Park for over 14 years .
i would like to thank him for the legacy he has left in the riding .
Mr. Flis , we salute , thank and applaud you .
the riding of Parkdale - High Park , a microcosm of Canada , is one of the most culturally and economically diverse ridings in this country .
it is a very united riding , a riding that takes strength from its diversity and its sense of community , a riding which is exemplary of what can be accomplished through community based activities and initiatives , a riding that shows that diversity does not equate to disunity .
i believe that fostering partnerships is a key to addressing the issues and challenges which we will face today and in the future .
in that context I would like to address three issues : job creation , the development of safe and prosperous communities , and the importance of the arts in articulating Canada ' s identity .
in its previous mandate this government committed to Canadians that it would ensure its strong economic fundamentals would be in place in order to promote economic recovery and job creation .
the Prime Minister and his government have been successful at meeting and surpassing their targets of deficit reduction .
the government predicts that we shall see the deficit eliminated well prior to the end of this mandate .
i commend my colleagues on their achievements .
our purpose must now be to take advantage of a vigorous economy and create jobs .
in my opinion , the government has a duty to ease job creation by promoting the kind of economic environment we need and by nurturing partnerships with the private and non - profit sectors .
the Minister of Finance has completed the first task .
the Minister of Industry and his colleagues are now responding to the second task with their jobs strategy .
one aspect of the jobs strategy is to target youth employment .
as the mother of three children I commend the government for the initiative it has recently undertaken with the announcement of the youth internship program .
this program is a partnership combining the efforts of the federal government , the YMCA , and Career Edge , the non - profit agency developed by 100 Canadian corporations to promote youth employment .
one of Canada ' s chartered banks has recently undertaken a comprehensive national study of the attitudes of Canada ' s nexus generation who are young people between the ages of 18 and 35 .
this study reveals that this group is much more entrepreneurial and positive than usually depicted .
one - third of nexus respondents stated that their most desirable profession was entrepreneur , suggesting that young Canadians are determined to turn their innovative ideas into business realities .
further to this , it is my belief that government does not create jobs , the private sector does .
in Canada over the last three years 70 per cent to 80 per cent of new jobs were created by small and medium size businesses .
small business needs access to capital , trade and technology .
government can help small business by encouraging banks , including the Business Development Bank of Canada , to lend money to these entrepreneurs .
as well , government can support small business by arranging trade missions such as the successful team Canada initiatives and the November trade mission to Washington for women business owners .
women - owned businesses are a significant sector of our economy .
as a founding member of the Women Entrepreneurs of Canada , I know first hand about the strength of women - owned businesses .
at the recent Women Leaders ' Network for APEC Economies held in Ottawa , it was noted that 700,000 companies in Canada are owned by women and that they employ 1.7 million people , which is greater than the Canadian Business top 100 companies .
they are also creating jobs at a rate four times the national average .
private trade missions should be encouraged .
organizations such as Les Femmes Chefs d ' Entreprises Mondiales are vehicles through which private citizens can act as goodwill ambassadors and introduce Canadian products and services to other countries .
in August I held job creation focus groups with business people , community leaders and residents in Parkdale - High Park .
i also met with leaders from the arts community and Women Entrepreneurs of Canada .
several critical points emerged from these discussions .
it was emphasized that it was important to support small business and to reduce the amount of official paperwork and red tape that is required for the functioning of a small business .
further , I was told about the real importance of developing strong community structures such as co - operative business development and the need to continue spending dollars on infrastructure which brings new technologies such as fibre optic cable and ISDN connections to the community .
although supporting technology is of primary importance , we must acknowledge there is a need for a healthy environment as well as excellent basic facilities such as skating rinks , parks and community centres .
a strong and prosperous community is safe and a safe community will be strong and thriving .
in Parkdale - High Park just last month the Parkdale Community Watch won the distinguished 1997 International Society of Crime Prevention Practitioners community based program of the year award .
this award acknowledges the success and initiative that Parkdale residents have taken toward combating crime in their community .
this government recognizes the importance of these initiatives as evidenced by the recent announcement by the Minister of Justice that $ 150 million will be allocated over the next five years to foster such community based programs .
creating partnerships with communities is essential .
the value of community impact statements must be acknowledged , particularly in the case of alleged victimless crimes such as drugs and prostitution where the impact on the community is significant .
consideration must be given to the imposition of more minimum sentences , allowing communities access to the briefing of federal judges and passing legislation to require the proceeds of crime to be reinvested into those communities affected .
my constituents strongly believe that health and justice must work together in partnership with communities not only to fight crime but to fight the causes of crime .
young offenders are one of the greatest tragedies of crime .
victims of crime are not alone in feeling their loss , society too experiences a loss - that of the potential of a young life .
we must redouble our efforts to rehabilitate young offenders and provide whatever support it takes to discourage repeat offenders .
we must , however , ensure that , in the case of violent young offenders , the needs and demands of the public form part of vigorous measures taken to protect society .
as a lawyer I applaud the Minister of Justice on her commitment to work with her provincial colleagues to reform the justice system in such a way as to better acknowledge the voice of all victims of crime .
i would now like to address one area about which I am particularly passionate , the arts in Canada .
as the former volunteer chair of one of Canada ' s foremost arts organizations I believe we must invest in programs , opportunities and partnerships which support our culture .
this is one of our greatest responsibilities .
a country ' s real strength lies in its people .
the arts and the culture of a people are the expressions of its heart and soul .
it is the movies , television , music , painting , dance and theatre that enable Canadians to laugh , talk and cry together .
through them we can express our identity and our similarities and differences .
i believe in investment , in investing in the development of original Canadian artistic product .
without our own product , without our own voices , without a generation that shares our vision to keep our culture alive and meaningful , Canada will have no legacy .
without this we will never get that opportunity to see our hopes and dreams reflected .
instead we will have to watch and live vicariously through others .
members will hear me speak in Parliament about the arts industry because I believe it is just that , an industry .
when we start looking at it that way some surprising things turn up .
the cultural sector represents a significant part of the Canadian economy .
the cultural sector contributes $ 25 billion to Canada ' s gross domestic product .
this means 900,000 jobs or 6.9 per cent of total employment .
last year Canadians spent over $ 2.9 billion on arts events and products .
for every dollar that the federal government has invested in the arts industry ten dollars of economic activity has been generated , an excellent rate of return .
these numbers do not even acknowledge the spin off effect the culture also brings to our economy .
" the House of Martin Guerre " a critically acclaimed production by Canadian composer Leslie Arden , brings people not only to the Canadian Stage Company but also to the restaurants , bars and hotels nearby .
in Canada , the arts play a leading role in enabling Canadians to define themselves in relation to one another and to the rest of the world .
if we want a strong national identity , we must ensure that control over our cultural institutions , publishing houses , radio and television networks and film productions rests with us .
the Liberal government believes that we should balance spending in this sector with a plan to invest in the future of Canadian culture .
artists and arts organizations will play a major role in determining how Canadians see themselves in 20 years .
the arts are on the cutting edge of the development of new communications and new technologies which will play a major role in not only the economic prosperity of Canada but in the world .
we should remember that the arts industry ' s sustenance and growth and the commensurate benefit to government revenues and Canadian society can be assisted by the Government of Canada without increasing the federal debt .
i applaud the federal government ' s commitment to cultural organizations such as the Canadian Publishing Development Corporation and the Canada Council for the Arts , which is celebrating its 40 th anniversary .
the creation of the Canada television and cable production fund has supported the creation of excellent Canadian programming .
we should acknowledge the unique and important voice that the CBC provides to Canadian culture and Canadian life .
we must continue to ensure the long term health of Canada and at the same time we should make sure we put in place partnerships to ensure that Canada ' s arts organizations and artists have a chance to continue to promote and develop the ideas , hopes and aspirations of all Canadians .
the time has come to show the world that Canada has writers , artists , directors and performers second to none , and that we can develop artistic endeavours here in Canada which will be produced all over the world .
canada as an exporter of Canadian cultural products and not an importer ?
i say welcome to the new millennium .
as members we have all been entrusted with an important responsibility , that of giving political leadership to Canada as we move into challenging times .
while we may not all agree on the policy steps required , we do all commit to serving the best interests of our country .
it is this difference of opinion that divides us into five parties and which will lead to spirited debate in this Parliament .
debates are at the heart of parliamentary democracy , where it is appropriate to support opposing views .
our political history has shown that the true superiority of the parliamentary system can be fully appreciated through the diversity of views being represented .
i am proud to confirm my support for the Prime Minister and the Government of Canada .
i vow to facilitate a true partnership among all Canadians toward making Canada an even greater country .
i hereby move , seconded by the hon. member for Beauce , that the following address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada :
to His Excellency the Right Honourable Rom é o A . LeBlanc , a Member of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada , Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada , Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Military Merit , Governor General and Commander - in - Chief of Canada .
may it please your Excellency :
we , Her Majesty ' s most loyal and dutiful subjects , the House of Commons of Canada , in Parliament assembled , beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to both Houses of Parliament .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to pay tribute to His Excellency the Governor General , Mr. Rom é o LeBlanc , and to thank him for giving the throne speech before both Houses .
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on being re - elected to the Chair .
we feel , and you have demonstrated to us , that you have all the qualities required for the important job of directing the work of the House .
i would also like to thank the Prime Minister , who honoured me by asking me to move the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne .
in addition , I would like to congratulate all my colleagues on being elected to office .
representing one ' s constituents well is no small challenge and I know that each of us , with God ' s help , will carry out our duties conscientiously , with respect for the institutions we serve and , of course , for the citizens of our country , Canada .
i represent the wonderful riding of Beauce .
i would like to take this opportunity to thank all my constituents for the very great honour they have bestowed on me by electing me to represent them in the House of Commons .
our economy is made up of businesses working in very diversified sectors .
from agriculture and forestry to manufacturing and the service industries , each sector is well represented in our economy .
and let us not forget our excellent maple syrup , a favourite with everyone .
it is because of these enterprises that it has often been said that the Beauce region is the kingdom of SMBs .
the Beauce region , along with the Chaudi è re - Appalaches region , has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Quebec , 6.1 per cent in August of this year .
what sets our region apart from others is that when we have a problem , we look for a solution , not a culprit .
instead of going over old ground when it was elected to office on October 25 , 1993 , the Liberal government helped put an end to the crisis .
today , after four years of Liberal government , Canada ' s economic performance is one of the best among the G - 7 industrial nations , and the future looks even more promising .
that is why Canadians can look forward with great hope to the future .
from the time of its first election in October 1993 , the Liberal government has made job creation its top priority .
in its Employment Strategy , the Liberal government has put public finances back on a sound footing , starting by addressing the problem of the huge deficits inherited from past governments .
it has reduced the deficit from $ 42 billion to under $ 14 billion .
this good management has made it possible to keep interest and inflation rates at their lowest .
these rates , moreover , help businesses to invest and to create jobs , which encourages purchases of major consumer goods .
once the budget is balanced , half of each billion dollar budgetary surplus will be used to cut taxes and reduce the debt .
the other half will be invested in important social and economic programs , including job creation initiatives .
our government believes in young people .
it invests annually in programs that enable young Canadians to acquire the knowledge and experience they need to get their careers off to a good start .
in addition , it recently announced the youth internship program in the federal public sector .
the government ' s priorities are first and foremost employment , improved public finances and Canadian unity .
for the past 130 years , Canada ' s achievements have earned this country the admiration of the whole world .
in fact , according to the United Nations , Canada happens to provide the best quality of life of any country in the world .
we have reached this level of excellence largely thanks to the values of equality and diversity which we hold dear .
to preserve and improve our federation is to preserve and improve the way we live .
the Liberal government has demonstrated the flexibility and vigour of Canadian federalism .
this same government has put forward new strategies for getting rid of duplication among levels of government , while showing greater respect for the jurisdictions set forth in the Constitution .
the manpower agreement , for instance , is an example of our government ' s desire for a modern federalism .
with the provinces , we have also reached an agreement on environmental harmonization .
we have withdrawn from programs of direct involvement in mining and forestry development and have suggested transferring management of social housing to the provinces .
finally , we suggested introducing federal - provincial mechanisms to deal with securities , food inspection and revenue collection .
the principle of a new federalism will continue to guide our actions during the government ' s present mandate .
every year , more than 300,000 Canadians learn French , in a country that should be proud of its two languages and two cultures .
i am proud to be part of this beautiful country we call Canada .
it is an honour and a privilege for me , as the new elected member for Beauce , to second the motion on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne moved by the hon. member for Parkdale - High Park .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate you on your re - election and will do so more formally and thoroughly tomorrow .
i would also like to congratulate the members for Parkdale - High Park and for Beauce on their excellent speeches .
i think they got the debate off on the right foot .
i now would like to move :
that the debate be now adjourned .
( on motion of Mr. Manning the debate was adjourned )

statements BY MEMBERS
monitor JET TRAINER AIRCRAFT
Mr. Bob Wood ( Nipissing , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to invite all members of Parliament to join me this evening at the National Aviation Museum for the unveiling of the Monitor jet trainer aircraft .
i am very proud of this success story which will see a surplus defence department hangar utilized to build the first Canadian made military jet in over two decades .
the hard work of the Air Base Property Corporation using Industry Canada and National Defence adjustment funds has paid off .
their partnership with Canadian Aerospace and Sikorsky will develop a new aerospace industry in North Bay .
i ask all members of the House to join me this evening at the Rockcliffe airport from 6 to 8 to view the future of military aviation manufacturing in Canada .
experts from the Canadian Aerospace Group and Sikorsky will be on hand to explain this unique project .
i look forward to seeing all members there this evening .

CHINESE CANADIANS
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to speak in the House for the first time .
more than 700,000 people of Chinese ancestry live in Canada today , but that was not always so .
in 1902 a royal commission decided that Asians were " unfit for full citizenship - obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to the state '' .
in 1923 Mackenzie King ' s Liberal government passed the exclusion act which suspended Chinese immigration .
Canadian Chinese call July 1 , 1923 , the day the exclusion act came into effect , humiliation day .
in 1947 the exclusion act was repealed and Canadians of Chinese ancestry won their right to be reunited with their families .
i would not be standing here today if that act had not been repealed .
1997 marks the 50 th anniversary of the repeal .
justice will be served only if Canada has learned a lesson from this bleak moment in history .

WHITBY WARRIORS
Ms. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to recognize the outstanding achievement of the Whitby Warriors Junior A Lacrosse Club .
this past August the Whitby Warriors won the Minto Cup as the best Junior A lacrosse team in Canada .
in spite of losing the first two games to the Burnaby Lakers they persevered and came back to win their next four games to take the best seven championship round in six games .
the Warriors were led by their top scorers Paul Sallie , Pat Jones and Gavin Prout and backed up by the most valuable player awarded winning performance of goal tender Mike Wye .
the Whitby Warriors are coached by Jim Bishop whose involvement in the sport of lacrosse spans some 51 years .
Whitby ' s win was Mr. Bishop ' s eighth Minto Cup , coming 28 years after coaching the legendary Oshawa Green Gaels to seven consecutive Minto Cup championships .
the determination and sportsmanship of the Whitby Warriors are an inspiration to us all .
i know all members will join with me in honouring the Whitby Warriors as the Junior A champions in Canada ' s national summer sport .

national DEFENCE
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in 1989 , the Department of National Defence was ordered by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to enrol more women in the next ten years .
at the time , only 9.9 per cent of the members of our armed forces were women .
today , eight years later , their numbers have remained virtually the same , with women accounting for a mere 10.7 per cent of the Canadian Armed Forces .
we note today that the Department of National Defence has not done a thing to recruit women .
but now they would have us believe they are complying with the Human Rights Tribunal order by launching a recruiting campaign aimed exclusively at women and known as " Operation Minerva '' .
DND knows very well it is impossible to integrate women fully by 1999 . All I have to say to that is : too little too late .
* * *
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Hamilton West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise , on this first full sitting day of the 36 th Parliament , to reiterate my call to the Ontario government for an independent public inquiry into the July Plastimet fire in Hamilton .
conservative Premier Mike Harris and his environment and health ministers have backtracked , flip - flopped on their pledges for an inquiry , citing the pathetic excuse of the need for evidence of wrongdoing .
is it right that the local MPP had to awaken the provincial environment minister at 3 a.m. before the premier would dispatch air monitoring equipment to the toxic fire site ?
why did the province first refuse and then later accept federal government assistance ?
there are questions of compliance with the Ontario fire code , inventory lists , security , and locating a recycling plant near a hospital , schools and a high density residential area .
frustrated with the Harris government smokescreen , my constituents demand an independent public inquiry to clear the smoke and to produce recommendations which might prevent an environmental tragedy like the Plastimet fire from ever happening again .

war CRIMINALS
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today in the House on a very important matter to my constituents of Thornhill , and I believe all Canadians , and that is the prosecution of war criminals .
the people of Thornhill , especially the Jewish community , believe that Canada must be vigilant in prosecuting war criminals .
canada has a moral obligation to deport those who have been found guilty of committing crimes against humanity .
we must not be seen as a haven for Nazi war criminals and others who have committed war crimes .
my constituents are aware of the commitment by the Liberal government to move on denaturalization and on deportation of those convicted of war crimes .
finally Canada is taking action .
canada is doing more now to track Nazi war criminals than almost any country in the world .
since 1995 many deportation cases have been initiated and I am confident we will continue to pursue war criminals to the fullest extent of the law .
while this issue is of special importance to the Jewish -

mother TERESA
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today so that the House and its members might pay tribute to the life and memory of Mother Teresa .
it was with great sadness that Canadians learned of her recent death .
this godly and gracious woman was a beacon of hope to the sick and the poor living in the streets of Calcutta and whose suffering she tried to ease and deeply felt .
her message to humanity was simple : yes , there is someone who cares .
it is a message that in our world will continue to resonate loudly and will no doubt serve as her lasting legacy .
with the passing of Mother Teresa the world will indeed be a colder place because the beacon of goodness , though not extinguished , burns a little less brightly today .
i am sure all Canadians join me in being thankful for her life .
i ask for all members to observe a time of silence in their own thoughts and pay tribute to the remarkable legacy of caring and giving that was Mother Teresa .
* * *
immigration
Mr. Gary Pillitteri ( Niagara Falls , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this year the International Whirlpool Bridge that links Canada and the U.S. celebrated its 100 th anniversary .
this important celebration reinforced the co - operation existing between our two great countries .
it is therefore difficult to believe that a new American immigration law will soon require that all Canadian travellers entering and exiting the United States complete a visa information card .
the community I represent is very concerned that this will cause endless hours of traffic jams and may damage the tourist and trade links we have established over a period of many years of co - operation .
it is then my sincere hope the proposed amendments exempting Canadians travelling to the U.S. each year are passed as soon as possible .
in the meantime I ask our government to keep pressure on our friends south of the border to implement the amendments so that this controversial law will not cause havoc in border communities across Canada .
* * *
ALGERIA
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , five months after condemning in this House the civil war in Algeria , the Canadian government has yet to call upon the international community to find a peaceful solution .
this silence has made it possible for the tragic events that took place in Benthala , Algeria , over Monday night , to occur .
the majority of the 200 people killed in this massacre were women and children .
in view of the increase in acts of terrorism and senseless violence in Algeria that have left more than 60,000 victims in recent years , according to Amnesty International estimates , Quebec , Canada and the international community must echo the voices of the bereaved families by utterly condemning the use of violence and seeking a political solution to the Algerian crisis .

speech FROM THE THRONE
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as a black Canadian from Quebec , of aboriginal and French descent , I am very proud to represent the riding of Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine in the 36 th Parliament of Canada .
the Speech from the Throne delivered yesterday is , in my opinion , a speech on national unity .
i wish to advise the House , and in particular the Hon. St é phane Dion , Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs -
the Speaker :
my dear colleague , you must not refer to hon. members by name , but by riding .
you have a few more seconds .
Ms. Marlene Jennings :
i wish to advise the House that my constituents are delighted with the initiatives of the government with respect to the Canadian unity file .
i want to assure the House that I intend to continue to contribute and encourage my constituents to actively support these very welcome and timely initiatives .
* * *
CANADIAN ECONOMY
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there can be no doubt that the Canadian economy is back on track .
the cost of living is going up very slowly , while retail trade is stronger than it has been in years .
statistics Canada announced that , between July and August , the consumer price index increased by 0.19 per cent , the same level as for the two previous months .
between August 1996 and August 1997 , Canadian consumers have faced an average increase of 1.8 per cent in the cost of living , which is pretty low .
all this is good news for Canadians .
* * *
pay EQUITY
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the federal government has decided to give public service executives bonuses totalling some $ 12.2 million , when close to $ 2 billion is owed to the 80,000 members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada , and when many Canadian families continue to live in poverty and unemployment .
the government is not in compliance with its own pay equity legislation .
while public service executives are getting significant bonuses , many clerks , secretaries and other employees are still not being paid the retroactive payments owed to them .
i hope the Treasury Board will pay what is owed to these employees and thus fulfill its commitment to female members of the public service and to women in general .
in order to correct this injustice , we are also asking that a new budget be tabled as early as this fall .
* * *
PRINCESS DIANA
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , death stalks all of us and can be cruel , but never more so than when it takes the life of the young .
on August 31 the world lost a beautiful soul in the death of Princess Diana .
and we all grieved .
we grieved not only for the loss of someone filled with so much promise , but also for someone in whom we saw ourselves .
she set an example in how to overcome our difficulties .
she taught us to reach inside ourselves to become something greater than what we are by helping those who are less fortunate .
Diana championed the plight of sick children , AIDS patients , the terminally ill .
recently she brought to the front of the world stage the horrors of landmines and their tragic victims .
as Canadians , we extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to the family of the Princess and especially to her sons , Princes William and Harry .
* * *
universit É DU QU É BEC À CHICOUTIMI
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , last Friday I had the pleasure of announcing on behalf of the Government of Canada the investment of $ 750,000 over five years , via the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council , in a new industrial engineering chair at the Universit é du Qu é bec à Chicoutimi .
the professor currently holding that chair , Masoud Farzaneh , will study the impact of freezing rain on power transmission network equipment .
two industrial partners , Hydro - Quebec and Alcan , have also contributed to the funding of this chair .
creation of this chair is evidence of the Liberal government ' s desire to work in conjunction with our partners in industry , the universities and provincial agencies to develop new knowledge which will improve electrical service and eliminate power outages caused by precipitation freezing on transmission lines .
this is further evidence that Canada is working to ensure the success of all Quebecers .
* * *
canada PENSION PLAN
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday ' s throne speech gives Canadians every reason to be worried about their future retirement plans .
older Canadians have earned the right to a secure retirement .
middle class workers cannot afford to pay more for the same benefits .
younger Canadians want the CPP to be there when they need it .
the Liberals plan to fix the CPP will be a further $ 11 billion tax hike on working Canadians and employers if the government refuses to reduce the EI premiums .
this government has a hidden agenda with the proposed seniors ' benefit .
it hurts middle income Canadians the most .
it disproportionately attacks women by basing it on family income and it discourages people to save for their retirement .
i ask the government to stop punishing Canadians who have worked and saved for their retirement and urge them to put the seniors benefit on hold until there are full consultations on the proposed plan .
* * *
mother TERESA
Ms. Albina Guarnieri ( Mississauga East , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , earlier this month the world lost the moral beacon of the 20 th century .
Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa led a life that challenged the modern world by teaching us that lifestyle is not more important than life .
she accumulated no material possessions , shunned political power and never succumbed to moral compromises .
her life was consumed by the simple goal of providing food , education , medical care , love and hope to the sick and desolate .
her notion of charity was not to hold black tie fundraisers and send others to do the messy work .
no , Mother Teresa ' s example was to pick the maggots out of people ' s open wounds herself .
no human has done so much , for so many , for so little .
but her life ' s work , not even respect for the dead , could spare her from those who want to protect their world from her message .
fully half of the media ' s coverage of Mother Teresa ' s death was devoted to criticism of her life and beliefs .
there are obviously many maggot infested wounds that still need to be cleansed by the millions she inspired .
she will be remembered simply and affectionately as Mother .
the Speaker :
before starting question period I want to share with you some of the intentions developed with the House leaders in consultation with me .
i know that this is the first day and I will give us all a bit of leeway .
however , I would like to ask you to consider joining with me in the days and weeks ahead in the following manner .
it would be my intention to shorten the length of time for both the questions and the answers from what we had in the last Parliament so that , on average , we can have more questions .
this will mean that the advance statements by the questioners will be shorter .
i would also ask for the help of the ministers to keep their responses shorter .
so now we shall see how things go today .
we will keep track of the time .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
government EXPENDITURES
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to be back in the House , and I am not just talking about Stornoway .
in his election platform the Prime Minister promised Canadians a 50:50 split between increased spending on one hand and debt and tax reduction on the other .
yet in yesterday ' s speech from the throne his government listed at least 29 new spending measures , but not one single practical measure for either debt reduction or tax relief .
was this simply an oversight ?
did he just leave something out of the speech or does this signal a return to Liberal chequebook spending ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the new Leader of the Opposition in this House .
we have made a commitment that very soon the country will be in a position to operate with a surplus .
the budget is scheduled for the month of February .
we have the time but first we have to go to a zero deficit .
we had to reduce the disastrous deficit of $ 42 billion left by the Conservative Party .
every year we are obliged to spend some money on some programs because of the problems in society which need to be taken care of .
it is always the Liberal approach to care and be responsible to others .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my colleagues and I find it inconceivable that the Department of Finance would truly endorse a return to spending as the number one fiscal priority of the government .
economists inside and outside the department have been saying for years that the federal government cannot spend its way to lower unemployment and that irresponsible spending and taxation is what is keeping unemployment high .
has the Prime Minister simply forgotten about the seriousness of the debt or the high tax levels , or is he telling the House that higher spending is the number one fiscal priority of his government ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , there are 29 proposals in the throne speech for higher spending and nothing on debt reduction or tax reduction .
if the government makes higher spending its number one priority , there will be no surpluses .
therefore 50 per cent of zero is zero , and there is zero for tax relief or debt reduction .
is not this 50:50 formula simply a shell game , like the GST promise in the previous election , to allow the government to do what it really wants to do , which is to return to excessive spending ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , obviously the Leader of the Opposition does not have anything very concrete on which to attack the government .
he is setting a target to shoot at .
we said very clearly we will spend more money when we are in a surplus position .
at the same time there are problems in society that have to be fixed and we will do it in a responsible way .
around the world today people look to Canada because we are an example of a fiscally responsible government and , at the same time , a government caring for those who need the most help in our society .
* * *
employment
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in February the Minister of Finance said a 5 per cent jobless rate was not only achievable but desirable .
however , according to his department this is hogwash .
it is forecasting 9 per cent , 8 per cent next year and 7 per cent until the year 2015 .
can the minister explain why he is publicly talking about a 5 per cent unemployment rate when privately his department says the opposite ?
who is right and who is wrong ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is wrong .
the debate to which the hon. member refers is a discussion over the natural rate of unemployment , the rate at which inflation would take off , and there is , in fact , a difference of opinion .
this government clearly states that an arbitrary number , like 8 per cent for a NAIRU , is not applicable to a country whose productivity is improving , a country where interest rates are low , a country whose industry has become lean and competitive .
all I can tell the hon. member is that Alan Greenspan agrees with me and I will take him over the member for Medicine Hat .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in Canada several economists say that the long term natural rate for unemployment is well over the 5 per cent that the minister is talking about .
under this government my 13 year old son will be middle aged before we get within shouting distance of that 5 per cent target .
when is the minister going to take the advice of the real job creators and cut taxes ?
Canadians want tax cuts .
i would like an answer from the prime minister - in - waiting , please .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it does the member good to be in the official opposition .
for the first time he understands the real political truths in this country .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
hon. Paul Martin :
no , not about me , but that they will never make it .
let me give a couple of numbers .
in the last four years under this Prime Minister the Canadian public has created over 970,000 new jobs .
this year under this Prime Minister the Canadian public has created over 260,000 new jobs , the vast majority of those in the private sector .
under this Prime Minister the youth unemployment rate has started to go down .
under this Prime Minister the -
some hon. members :
more , more .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Governor General read a speech from the Throne that contained a number of particularly moving , even lyrical , passages on Canada in the 21 st century .
the reality of the matter , however , is quite something else .
will the Prime Minister not acknowledge that the Speech from the Throne sanctions his vision of Canada , where all major decisions will be made in Ottawa , with the provinces being relegated to the position of subsidiaries of Ottawa , and where Quebecers as a people have no place ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we made frequent reference in the Speech from the Throne to the partnership we want with the provinces .
we made frequent reference in the Speech from the Throne to what we intend to do for the children of poor families in Canada .
i would like to make it clear to the former Leader of the Opposition that , at the first ministers ' meeting in June last year , all the provincial governments and premiers in attendance , including the Premier of Quebec , agreed to our establishing a child credit program to help poor families .
this shows that we can work together within Canada as partners .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister uses the term " partners " because he thinks it is a popular term and would give it the same meaning it was given by the sovereignists .
however , we have no illusions about this , because when the Prime Minister talks about partnership , it is the kind of partnership in which the political decisions are made in Ottawa and the provinces are asked to carry them out .
the provinces are being treated like so many municipalities .
would the Prime Minister agree that the throne speech has demonstrated , more clearly than ever before , that there are two diametrically opposed visions of Canada : one in Quebec where , since Jean Lesage , people have wanted to be " ma î tres chez nous " and one in the rest of Canada , the one in the Calgary declaration where Quebecers are just as unique as Pacific salmon ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the leader of the third party overlooks the fact that we have worked very hard with the provinces since we came to power .
take , for instance , Quebec ' s traditional demands regarding manpower training .
we have entered into an agreement with the provincial governments , including the Government of Quebec .
for many years , the Government of Quebec and the other governments complained that we were involved in areas they would rather see us out of .
that is why we withdrew from forestry , mining , tourism , social housing and manpower training .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister wanted , he said , to launch an appeal to citizens to work together to save Canada , except that nothing about the speech is likely to please Quebec .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
will he confirm that his party has buried the concept of distinct society once and for all and replaced it with the concept of " unique character '' ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to point out to the member for Roberval that he voted against distinct society here in this House .
i also want to point out to the member for Roberval that , when he was an MNA , he voted against the Meech Lake accord in the National Assembly .
and I am very pleased with the premiers ' attitude in this regard .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in exchanging niceties with the Prime Minister , might I remind him that he was the one who was traipsing all over Quebec during the last election campaign promising Quebecers that he would sell the rest of Canada on the idea of a distinct society , not I.
is the Prime Minister now telling us that once again he is going to change his story and not fulfil the commitment he made to the voters of Quebec ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have always stressed the necessity of recognizing the distinct character of Quebec because of its language , its culture , and its Civil Code .
the formula the premiers saw fit to accept a few weeks ago is a new one which describes the Quebec reality , something we continue to fight for , while the Bloc Quebecois , in the House of Commons , and the Parti Quebecois , in the National Assembly , have voted against anything which could accommodate Quebec so as to enable it to prosper within Canada .
* * *
employment
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have waited a long time for this moment .
my question is to the Prime Minister .
on behalf of 1.4 million unemployed Canadians , will the government commit today to set clear timetables and targets for the reduction of unemployment ?
the government has done it with respect to deficit reduction .
when will the government do the same for unemployment and show that it is serious about putting Canadians back to work ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to welcome the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party to the House of Commons .
i am happy to have her here .
i know she has waited a long time and I hope she will stay for a long time too .
i would like to say that we want to reduce unemployment and we are working very hard on it .
the first thing we had to do was to put the finances of the nation in order .
a few years ago we had a deficit of $ 42 billion and very soon we will have reduced it to zero .
we have to do that in order to create jobs .
when there is no inflation , low interest rates and a competitive dollar , we can produce and be very competitive .
it is in that way that we will create the jobs .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is obvious that 155 Liberal cheerleaders over there are pretty pleased with their record .
since the last Liberal throne speech promised to tackle youth unemployment , 26,000 more young people in this country have not been able to find jobs and they are not cheering .
if not , will it admit that it has simply given up doing anything to help the young people who most desperately need its help ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have tried to explain in a few words that we must have the basic elements to create jobs in the country .
it is not by spending money that we will cure the problems of the nation .
we have to do it in a responsible way and we have to put the books of the nation in order .
i would like to quote some advice I read on February 10 of this year .
it was said that we have come too far and have worked too hard to restart the cycle of careless spending .
therefore , we will not follow the advice of the leader of the New Democratic Party .
we will follow the advice of Mr. Roy Romanow who spoke in front of the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
his government said in the Speech from the Throne that it cares about unemployment in general and about youth unemployment in particular .
the government could take concrete action immediately by reducing employment insurance premiums .
this is what the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , as well as Quebec ' s Chamber of Commerce and Conseil du patronat , are asking for .
what is this government waiting for to end this abuse and put people back to work ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I wish to welcome the Conservative Party leader , who is now back in the front row .
we are happy to see him and look forward to be closer to him and to see him more often than in the last Parliament .
the Conservative Party leader should know that , when we came to office , the unemployment insurance fund showed an enormous deficit , because the Conservative government had not exercised prudence .
the Conservatives had to increase premiums from $ 2 to $ 3.30 , at a time when unemployment was on the rise in Canada .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the Prime Minister for his kind words in welcoming me back to the House .
i would caution him against wishing that I be here too often and remind him of the old Chinese proverb that he may end up getting what he wishes for .
today I want to offer the Prime Minister a great opportunity , an opportunity to do something for unemployed Canadians and young unemployed Canadians .
if he acts today he can put thousands of people back to work in the next few weeks by reducing employment insurance premiums , this tax , this rip - off on Canadians to the tune of billions of dollars .
to be clear , I want to ask the Prime Minister one simple , straightforward question .
does he and his government believe that this employment insurance system should be used for the purpose of reducing the deficit , yes or no ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we did not want to run the affairs of the nation the way that the previous government did .
it never had any surplus in the unemployment insurance fund .
we want to act as prudent managers in order to make sure that our financial situation is good in Canada and that we have low interest rates .
we have that now and that is what is creating the 4 per cent growth that we will have this year in Canada .
we are the leaders of the G - 7 countries in this .

miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the equality of citizens and provinces became a huge factor and played a large part in the Calgary premiers conference last week .
in fact their framework for discussion listed the word equality five times .
yet yesterday in the throne speech we did not hear the word equality even once ; uniqueness , diversity , all kinds of words , but not equality .
my question for the Prime Minister is in yesterday ' s throne speech why in the world was the equality of citizens and provinces deliberately left out ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , when we said we want to work in partnership and in collaboration with the provinces it is because we believe in equality .
that is exactly the purpose of it .
about the equality of individuals , I do not have any lessons to receive from the hon. member for Edmonton North because I was the minister of justice who gave the charter of rights to all citizens of Canada to make them equal .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the concept of equality and the word equality is what is important .
speaking of justice ministers , it is a wonder that this justice minister did not notice the absence of the word equality and insist that it be put in the throne speech .
it is very strange that the government would mention the unique character of Quebec society and the diversity inherent in the federation and yet not mention equality .
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is something I have talked about and lived by for the last 34 years that I have been a member of Parliament .
this is very important .
equality means that we recognize the people for what they are .
in a family equality means that sometimes we have to have solutions that are meeting the needs in one part of Canada but which are not needed elsewhere .
we have , for example , despite equality a terrible problem of poverty in Canada .
this means that those who are rich have to help those who are poor .
the Speaker :
the hon. member for T é miscamingue .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Prime Minister .
in the throne speech we heard that the federal government , as its financial position improves , intends to intervene increasingly in areas of provincial jurisdiction , including health and education .
how can the Prime Minister justify increasing involvement by its government in health and education , considering that these areas have always been the responsibility of provincial governments ?
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canada happens to be one of the most decentralized federations in the world , and together we have built a federation that has provided us with the best quality of life of any country .
and we managed to do this because both levels of government , federal and provincial , are learning to work together and to concentrate on the areas for which they are responsible .
in the health sector , the federal government ' s responsibilities are those that are recognized in the Constitution .
there is nothing unconstitutional about having five moral principles that are accepted throughout Canada , including Quebec , and as a result can be applied anywhere in Canada , both in the wealthiest and the less wealthy provinces .
i may remind the hon. member that the province that benefits the most per capita from the Canada Social Transfer happens to be Quebec .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is the first time a federal government has so clearly indicated its intention of interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction , especially education .
would the Prime Minister or his minister agree that his program to measure the readiness of children to learn is , in fact , a foot in the door of the education sector , with all the consequences that involves : federal programs , federal assessment criteria , federal employees , and on top of that , taxpayers who will again pay twice as a result of this latest duplication ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am always amazed by the excessive reactions we get from that side of the House .
however , if they get their kicks by measuring the orthodoxy of every word , by all means , let them make a study of semantics .
what we promised in the throne speech yesterday was to let Canadians benefit from a study by Statistics Canada , for which my department is responsible .
i am referring to a national longitudinal survey we have been doing for several years .
since we invest enormous amounts of money in the well - being of our children , we feel it is very important to measure their progress , so that when they go to school , they are in the best possible position to learn .

national UNITY
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , except for Premier Bouchard , who did not attend the Calgary conference , all of Canada ' s provincial premiers agreed to put the question on national unity to the Canadian people .
does the Prime Minister think it is acceptable for Quebecers to be the only Canadians who will not be consulted on national unity ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for his question .
right now , the provincial governments have made a joint decision to consult the people before adopting resolutions in their respective legislatures .
in the case of Quebec , the present government of Quebec is not interested in consulting Quebecers on their genuine participation within Canada .
right now , the provinces have decided to consult their citizens before adopting their resolution .
as soon as Quebec wants to adopt its resolution , I would ask the Government of Quebec to do likewise .
as far as we are concerned , if these resolutions are passed or adopted by all the provinces , I said before that the House of Commons has voted on distinct society , and we are prepared to vote on the words chosen by the premiers after a debate in this House .
but we will have to wait and see what happens in the provinces , which are working on this right now .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Mr. Bouchard has said that he will not take part in any public consultation process .
Meech Lake and Charlottetown failed because Canadians were not consulted .
knowing this , will the prime minister clarify how the Calgary declaration will be communicated to the people of Quebec and by whom ?
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , with due respect to the hon. member , on Charlottetown people were consulted .
there was a referendum .
among the reforms that we favoured was the election of the Senate .
the Reform Party voted against it .
at this moment the provinces are doing their work .
in due course we will act .
i have talked with the premiers and they are doing , in a very different way , the way they want , their own consultations before they vote on the issue .
we do not want to duplicate that in the other provinces .
at this moment there is no debate going on before the national assembly on the question of the Calgary declaration .
when there is a debate I hope they will consult with the people .
if need be we might consult with them , but at this moment the timing is not appropriate .

speech FROM THE THRONE
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the throne speech , the government claims to be sensitive to the problems of low income families with children and the problems in the education and health case systems .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
does the Minister of Finance admit that the problems the government has identified in these areas are basically due to the cuts of over $ 40 billion it made during its first mandate and intends to keep on making during this mandate ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , because of the efforts made by this government , and indeed all Canadians , in terms of putting our fiscal house in order , the government can now afford to provide assistance to society ' s most disadvantaged , namely poor children .
in fact , our intentions were not expressed only in the throne speech .
judging from recent budgets and the actions taken by my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development , and by other colleagues regarding the child tax credit , internship programs and all this government has put in place for the poor in this country , it is very clear that what our government intends to do is to help Canadians , not to divide them .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the axeman seldom woos his victims , but that is what the Minister of Finance is doing , since he is responsible for poverty in Canada .
by the way , will the minister admit that his solution to health , education and poverty problems is to cut $ 42 billion instead of $ 48 billion as initially planned ?
in other words , all he has to offer as a solution is to cut $ 6 billion less than he had planned .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that the hon. member across the way , where he was before the election , compare the first Campeau budget tabled when the Parti Quebecois took office in Quebec with the forecast now being made by Mr. Landry .
he will see that , thanks to federal activities and initiatives , the amount available to Mr. Landry to help the disadvantaged is $ 1.5 billion higher than originally planned by Mr. Campeau .
i do hope the PQ government will use this money to help the most disadvantaged in Quebec .

health CARE
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the health minister was recently asked where he would find the money for national pharmacare , he replied : " I don ' t know but it ' s a really good idea '' .
when patients are trapped in the longest waiting lines in history why would anybody be thinking about a brand new national program ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the first and fundamental challenge we face with our health care system , and I know the hon. member is aware of this , is restoring the confidence of Canadians in the basic medicare which we have come to know and depend on .
the government is firmly committed to not only the five principles of the Canada Health Act but to working with our partners in the provinces , with providers and with other stakeholders in the system to restore the health system to the quality Canadians expect and deserve .
that is going to mean a lot of work .
it is going to mean working with provinces and others to tackle issues such as waiting lists .
it is going to mean dealing with -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Macleod .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
i call that clueless .
medicare has suffered and lies wounded .
why would anybody carry on with a brand new program like this when medicare itself needs to be fixed ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I know the hon. member is a better doctor than he is a mathematician .
he knows full well that the cuts by this government were nowhere near 40 per cent .
what I said to my provincial partners is that we are going to work toward pharmacare as a long term goal because this government believes that in the long term the partners should work with us in creating a system where every citizen of this country should have access to the drugs they need and should not be kept from them because of price .

employment INSURANCE
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
the Liberal government has cut unemployment insurance by billions of dollars , turning a deaf ear to the cries of alarm coming from the unemployed and from seasonal workers .
how can the minister justify a throne speech that contains nothing at all for the unemployed and for seasonal workers , when he knows that the unemployment insurance fund will again this year produce a surplus of at least $ 7 billion ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member will have to take another look at the throne speech , because there are several references to what we are going to do and have been doing for some time now .
in particular , we announced a youth employment strategy , which is extremely important .
we are working very hard on the unemployment issue and you know it .
this strategy , which creates work experience , is doing well .
we have identified tools that worked well and we will consolidate and extend them so that the work experience young people need to make the transition from school to the work place is a very positive one .
there is also the transitional job creation fund , $ 95 million of which has been invested in job creation in Quebec .
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear from the minister ' s reply that he is not in the least concerned about the plight of seasonal and other workers entering the job market .
my question is not what he is doing to help them re - enter the job market , but what he is doing to help them survive and not all end up on welfare .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are very concerned about the situation the member describes and I would appreciate it if he listened to the reply , because it is important that he tell his constituents and all those living in his riding what to do .
we have set up a transitional job creation fund .
we do not believe in passive income support .
that is what our workers want .

immigration
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
a new American law requiring Canadians crossing into the United States to undergo a lengthy and invasive inspection process could have disastrous effects on Sault Ste. Marie tourism and the normal flow of business between our city and its American neighbours .
what steps is the federal government taking to ensure Canadians will continue to have easy access to the United States ?
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the new measures announced by the United States are extremely damaging to Canadian and to American business .
they are counter to the initiatives taken by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister to dismantle controls at borders and to promote the free circulation of people and of goods .
they are probably counter to NAFTA .
our objective is to secure the removal of those controls from application at the Canada - U.S. border .
we are encouraged already in our efforts by the amendments introduced by a member of the United States Senate and a member of the United States Congress to this effect .

fisheries
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government has made a mess of the Pacific salmon dispute .
we have seen four years of mismanagement on this file .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s assertion is incorrect .
the issue , however , of the salmon treaty is an important one .
i am disappointed the fisheries critic of the official opposition would choose for his first question such a trivial , irrelevant and inaccurate comment as the one he has made .
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech contains not one word about resolving the Pacific salmon dispute .
the government continues to show a lack of commitment to British Columbia .
will the minister make resolving the treaty by January 31 the number one priority of his department ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are again hearing questioning by Reform members who obviously have not read the throne speech or listened to it .
the fact is that in the throne speech there is a clear commitment to continue to deal with the issue of foreign overfishing .
if the fisheries critic of the official opposition knew something about the problem of the Pacific salmon treaty , he would know that it began because the Alaskans overfished Canadian bound sockeye salmon in northern British Columbia going to the Nass and Skeena Rivers , to the tune of three times what they had done previously under the treaty .
that is what he has not understood and he has not understood that the throne speech addresses it directly .

petitions
health AND DRUG ACT
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present three petitions on the same subject that vary a bit .
each of them calls on the government to reject proposed changes to the Canada Health and Drug Act that would prevent people from taking dietary supplements or herbal goods of their own choice .
national HIGHWAYS
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my congratulations on your re - election , Sir .
i have two petitions to present today .
the first petition is signed by 30 of my constituents and calls upon Parliament to urge the federal government to join with the provincial governments in making the national highway system upgrading possible beginning in 1997 .
criminal CODE
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is signed by 57 of my constituents .
it calls upon Parliament to enact legislation to amend the Criminal Code , specifically sections 173 and 174 , the indecent act and public nudity provisions , to clearly state that a woman exposing her breasts in a public place is an indecent act .
co - OPERATIVES
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure today to present a petition on behalf of 57 constituents who live in a co - op housing project on 610 Beatrice Street in my riding .
in part they indicate that the Government of Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation have begun secret negotiations with the province of Ontario , that the people who own and operate co - operatives have been excluded from these negotiations , and that the Government of Ontario has already breached its own agreements with provincially funded housing co - operatives .
they pray that the minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing will immediately suspend negotiations on social housing with the province of Ontario and resume negotiations only if the minister proceeds under publicly declared principles established with the input of the co - operative housing stakeholders .

government ORDERS
speech FROM THE THRONE
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
first I congratulate you on your re - election to the Chair .
i extend best wishes to you on behalf of the members of the official opposition .
we wish you patience and wisdom in your deliberations in guiding our deliberations and express the hope that the spirit of democracy expressed on the first day you were elected will continue throughout this Parliament .
congratulations to you , Sir , on behalf of all of us .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
we would like to congratulate the hon. member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie , the leader of the Bloc Quebecois , and his colleagues on their election .
while we disagree profoundly with the policies of the Bloc , we respect the democratic process that permitted the election of Bloc members to this House .
we will continue to try to convince them and their electors that real reform of the federation is possible and preferable to separation from it .
to the hon. member for Halifax and our NDP colleagues we extend congratulations as well .
i also ask the leader of the NDP to convey our best wishes to her predecessor , Ms. Audrey McLaughlin .
so often members leave the Chamber of their own accord after serving their time with little acknowledgement or recognition .
i ask members to simply join in applauding Ms. McLaughlin for her hard work , her compassion and her contribution to Canada .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
Mr. Preston Manning :
i congratulate the leader of the Conservative Party and his colleagues .
i congratulate the Right Hon. Prime Minister .
he has had a long career in politics .
we were attempting to terminate it a little earlier but we were not quite successful .
Jason Moscovitz on the night of the election said that the member for Sherbrooke won the leaders debate , that Reform won the campaign but that the Prime Minister won the election .
we would have preferred his victory to ours .
i would also like to congratulate the prime minister and his gracious wife Aline on their 40 th wedding anniversary a few weeks ago .
if she can put up with the prime minister for 40 years I guess we can put up with him for another four .
to all hon. members I would like to extend congratulations on elections and re - elections .
i would like to say to all the younger MPs and to the new MPs that we wish to encourage them .
i think they can bring invigoration and a fresh spirit to this institution which sometimes shows signs of age .
i would encourage all members to encourage these new members and to give them the respect they deserve .
they do represent really the vanguard of the future and we welcome them to this House .
last of all but not least I want to acknowledge and thank the people of Calgary Southwest .
as I have frequently said to them , this seat in my judgment does not belong to me .
it does not belong to my party .
it is their seat .
turning to more important business , on June 2 over 12 million Canadians participated in the federal election .
when the ballots were counted the seats were allocated , whether we like it or not , the way we see them in the House .
it seems to me at the outset it would be important to ask ourselves precisely what did Canadians do on June 2 and what message were they endeavouring to send by what they did .
i suggest they were saying four things .
first , they reduced the representation of the both the government party and the official opposition of the last Parliament ; fewer seats for the Liberals and fewer seats for the Bloc .
there is a message in that of dissatisfaction .
it was not enough dissatisfaction to upset the government but it was dissatisfaction that the government needs to heed .
second , the public increased support for three very different parties , the Reform Party , the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives .
there is a message in that .
the public is searching for different ideas and different personalities to represent different realities in the country .
that is one the public wants to see , for better or for worse , reflected in the House .
it is incumbent on us to reflect that .
the third is one of the most interesting things .
when historians write about the 1997 election I think this is one of the things they will single out .
the Canadian people regionalized this Chamber in a way that they have not done for a long time .
if we look at the votes , while Reform got one million votes east of the Manitoba - Ontario border , all our seats are in the west .
the Bloc is exclusively a Quebec party .
even within Quebec its vote is regionalized primarily in the area east of Montreal .
the NDP is divided between members in Atlantic Canada , in the west , but with no seats at all in central Canada .
the Progressive Conservatives have 90 per cent of their seats east of Ontario , with a majority in Atlantic Canada .
while the Conservatives will continue to represent themselves as a national party in the House they are in essence an Atlantic party with a Quebec contingent .
for the government of course two - thirds of its seats are in Ontario , with half of the remainder in Quebec .
while in theory it too is a national party , or claims to be a national party , in fact in the House it is an Ontario party with a Quebec contingent .
if there is a lesson in this , it is that this country continues to pay a price for failing to reform the upper house .
in Germany , Australia , the United States and in other big federations of the world regional interests are expressed in their federal arenas through an effective upper chamber .
when you do not have that one of the consequences is a regionalization of your lower house .
those who think regionalization of this House is a backward step or something that will hurt national unity should join the ranks of those who demand an effective upper chamber to represent regional interests .
the fourth thing that Canadians did in 1997 was allow a 10 year old federal party , with roots in the west and proud of it , and with aspirations to become a truly national party , to occupy the role of official opposition and to become the alternative to the government .
as we begin that new role and analyse the Speech from the Throne , we owe it to the public to share with it how we see this role being discharged .
we see ourselves as having a twofold mandate .
the first is to hold the government accountable , to commend it on actions which we consider in the national interests but to criticize it on actions which we consider not to be in the national interests .
second , we see our role as one of proposing constructive alternatives consistent with the big themes of equality , accountability and fiscal responsibility on which our members were elected .
in relation to the Speech from the Throne I would like to perform these two functions .
i want to commend the government where it deserves commendation .
we want to criticize the features of the speech which we consider inadequate .
most important , we want to present constructive alternatives where we see those deficiencies .
as the Speech from the Throne remarked , the 36 th Parliament of Canada is a transition Parliament .
it is the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first of the 21 st century .
therefore people can ask in which direction it is going to look .
is it going to continually look back over its shoulder at old ideas and concepts from the past or is it going to squarely face the future ?
the throne speech professes to look ahead .
it is important that we look at the reality behind the words .
i see a great historical and political analogy between the end of the 19 th century politically and the end of the 20 th century .
by the end of the 19 th century the governing party , the Conservative Party , had run out of leadership , ideas and energy .
it had run out of steam .
Macdonald , the guiding light , was gone .
the lesser lights , though well meaning , who took his place were unable to build on the foundation which he had laid .
once new ideas , such as the federal union , the national policy or the transcontinental railway , were by that point in time the status quo .
as J . Arthur Lower the historian put it , the once vital era of Macdonald sputtered to a dreary conclusion after the death of its guiding spirit .
while an exhausted government was still running the country , Canada itself was bursting with the new ideas , new energies and new potentials of the 20 th century , and while the government was mired in the past , the people started to seek ways and means to express their frustrations with a government whose time had past .
with their desire to see new ideas expressed in the federal arena they started to search for new personalities and new groups .
the personality they settled on was Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the new group of MPs around him .
the throne speech quotes Sir Wilfrid Laurier .
he was talking about fiscal realities .
he described Canada not as a country led and inspired by government policy but as a young giant shackled and manacled by government policy .
he said about the need for a fresh start : " I say that the time has come for gentlemen on the other side to cease their boasting and self - glorification and for the people of the country to open their eyes and see that a new departure must be made from the policy which has been followed for the last 10 years .
i have said that a change has become absolutely necessary to the well - being of the country '' .
sir Wilfrid Laurier on the weakness of the previous government ' s legislative program in a debate on the speech from the throne , precisely like this , said : " The speech from the throne has been for some years past a very dry skeleton .
this year it is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' .
i see a striking parallel between the end of the 19 th century politically and the end of the 20 th .
the once great Liberal Party is running out of steam .
the throne speech , despite forward looking language , offers no brilliant illumination of the horizon of the new millennium .
there is no connection to the forces of innovation and change and reform that are at large in the country which if harnessed to national policy will help propel Canada into the 21 st century with vigour and optimism .
i say in applying glorious analogy to this throne speech , it is a dry bone speech lacking in the flesh and blood and muscle and sinew and heart and soul required to inspire Canadians for the 21 st century .
i would apply the words exactly : " The speech from the throne has been for some years a very dry skeleton .
this year is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' .
with this sobering historical parallel and Laurier ' s analogy before us let us analyse the government ' s speech from the throne .
we want to examine the dry bones .
we want to give credit where credit is due .
as any dog will tell you , a dry bone is better than no bone at all .
where deficiencies exist what we will endeavour to do is not simply to be critical but to offer new ideas that can perhaps turn this dry bones throne speech into something vibrant and new and appropriate to leading the country into the 21 st century .
let me look first at the economy .
the government proposes little with respect to the economy .
it mentions none of the resource sectors .
it mentions nothing about the manufacturing sector .
it does mention investing in knowledge and creativity .
we find all the government ' s references to high technology tiresome because the rhetoric is there and yet we cannot even get electronic voting in this House .
